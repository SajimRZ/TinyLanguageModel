Lol but still dies to other heroes powers
There are no comics about him. He just pops up randomly in others comics to kill a big bad
â€‹Â @TheeDustPannÂ  Surprise Attack
Â @TheeDustPannÂ  Nah, he gets a comic run about him, but the entire run follows the perspective of the villains.
â€‹Â @TheeDustPannÂ There are surprise attack comics. They just don't have Surprise Attack in them until the 43rd issue where he appears once and never again until it will once again be surprising
Y'know he could be a really good semi-gag character
Basically superhero agent 47
Â @GCheckCentralÂ  nothing like him
And worst of all, he's literally immortal
Â @Itz_GuyMajinÂ eternal
Agree
It could be like darkman
Random vilain:*sleeping*
Surprise attack:*appears out of nowhere and whisper in his ear* surprise attack
@faraf0302Â  i could see surprise attak attacking in dreams and if you die there, you are death
â€‹Â @faraf0302Â 
You could make the entire series come from villain perspectives knowing he exists but not when he is going to strike. And like they are dealing with a horror monster they go and try to keep themselves alive by working to the monsters weaknesses in this case if you expect it, he cannot strike but then at the very end of the issue he is there in the most unexpected ways. Or through the comic is he picking of people like some kind of predator alien.
Â @DotTiuriÂ  yes pls. I need this. 
"And at that point, it wouldn't be a surprise anymore therefore it can be a surprise again! "
What if: surprise attack stood in front of a villain then surprise attack them in the back (they won't expect it at all)
"I HAVE CONQUERED THE WORLD, now's time for a good shower"

"SURPRISE ATTACK"
I just imagine villains in their houses having nightmares about surprise attack just appearing in their sleep
Would be perfect in a deadpool movie
tf2 logic against spies. lol
Except he gets surprise attacked too each time
Surprise attack is amazing

What if they "expect the unexpected"?
@FS1041-gc3kpÂ  then they'd expect him to not appear...
Â @tf2lul-gc3kpÂ  Then you see how long they can keep up their guards against the unexpected.
Spy be like
At the moment they let their guard down he comes back
Omg I would pay to see that.
And whenever a villain is taken down without someone taking credit for it, they'll assume it as surprise attack, not knowing he has been retired for decades.
It could be you! It could be me! It could even be...
Imagine if his power is swapping bodies! That's be awesome
But then they are always expecting him to
He is one 
He could be like Deadpool especially since he is already immortal
What's this song playing when he shows up ?
Which would make it not a surprise which would make it a surprise which would make it not a surprise, ect ect, paradox
With hero movie tech though I feel like having some kind of reminder on surprise attack existing should be able to remove the surprise from him defeating him
AKA Batman
If theyâ€™re always expecting him, would that mean heâ€™ll never come?
@cylewhittington5Â  that'd also be funny as hell, just half the movie in the villain scared for their life
basically batman
Someone please tell me where can I get that jacket (inner one) of the main villain I am looking for that everywhere
Dude the cop has survived every attack in this series
yeah if they ever werent they are dead.
True
Technically in marvel he already exist as moonknight 
You know he will come eventually but until it happens you will never know
Gonna use him in my story
Then he would just do an obvious attack until they relax! Lmao
Wait hold on is that TOROKO CAVE STORY
â€‹Â @PERSONIFICATIONOFAHUMANÂ  No :( I did edit their halloween sprite to make my own custom one tho, so close enough!
So spy from tf2
but if the villains are expecting him to attack at all times, then he's powerless against them, isn't he?
Isn't that just what Batman does?
Bro ruined the comment by saying lmfao
Imagine him as the character "King" from One Punch Man who pretty much has the same plot armor but not the protagonist
â€‹â€‹Â @Stratogizer_413Â isn't he the one that faked being a hero I think
Yes

Surprise attack
Â @averagecyclops6082Â with this treasure I summo--
The Cop when he sees a new villain: "Yeah, I'm going to go now."
He is suprise attack
Technically surprise attack is the protagonist he even has a backstory
Ä° think the enemy protagonist is the guy with hammer that is fressed up as a jester
Maybe his power is to attract heroes. The heroes just happen to be inexperienced lmao
No its king from OPM
He's the real superhero
Do you know the power of someone army of superheroes that will or even just some superheroes sounds like a really cool power it would probably make you super dangerous
The cop hired the surprise attack
Bro is King from OPm
I thought the same thing, he is like cosmoem from Pokemon, keeps summoning ultra beasts
Â @gladeon-hb9iuÂ  yay cosmoem
Facts
LMBO
Maybe its his hidden power
I have questions. Can he respawn in the same tub twice? Or does the tub die instead of him?
Â @AmyFlannigan27Â  Clearly the tub wasn't destroyed when he respawned. So as long as there is even a single bathtub is intact he can respawn
Humor me this, he keeps the world's smallest bathtub in his pocket, or a backpack
Imagine he respawns in your bathtub while youâ€™re taking a bath
Surprise Attack did his job then
Agreed. It was a genuine surprise this time.
I was expecting him, but I wasn't expecting him to be that guy.
Then yeah i guess it worked
He always surprised us
This youtuber is the one of the best comedy channel to exist.
He always comes back

SURPRISE!
Surprised me
Honestly that's a pretty good superpower to have
â€‹Â @garyeslicjk4112Â  Yeah bcs you don't have the existential dread problem of having to see the death of the universe. You die in space, no more bathtub, you finally die.

it should become livingbathtub
Actually the most busted power, any bathtub? Unless the world actively searches for every single bathtub in existence, he will truly never die.

Shouldn't it be the living bathtub?
Shouldnâ€™t it be livingbathub then, low key kinda hard
that name was reccomended by someone in the comments
Bathtubliving! You will die 11 seconds jolyne!
What's more hilarious than the names is how he actually comes up with a dumb power related to it

I mean, I would be scared to
Â @Renibo137Â  Imagine hanging out with your life best friend then you turn your back to them and he says "Suprise attack!"
Its because surprise attack used to be the only one to successfully defeat villains

i too world be scared if a guy was not even able to die to get his existends erased XD
â€‹Â @scorpdelord883Â  if that happened it would be surprising
I'm so proud of Surprise Attack to make a name for himself.
He is immortal his power is so broken 
â€‹Â @thinhtonguyen9576Â  he will never due to his ability need him to be alive to do the surprise. People thought he died so if he's alive it's a surprise
His Power so OP tho

Its apply for defensive and offensive while also a bad luck

People would be surprised he is back from the dead

People will be surprised he will attacking in the most weirdest way (Throwing Poo)

People will be surprised he will act in unnatural way (such as jumping infront of the enemy attack)

And all the power came from... His artifact
I mean, heâ€™s kinda op tho, virtual immortality, endlessly unpredictable, and could probably take out some big league villains with ease. Heâ€™s just incredibly unlucky as a side effect
I mean one of the villans can be suprise attack
Wtf?
Skunk bear is actually pretty cool, even if his powers are unorthodox
"I am the night... I am vengeance... I am SURPRISE ATTACK!"

         -Surprise Attack, probably


No seriously though, bro does a better job at being a symbol of fear to terrify criminals than Batman himself.

fact
Surprise Attack got hit by a stampede of random animals one of them summoned, in addition to the brief death of BathtubLiving.
you forgot abt suprise attack
Wym? Surprise attack got ran over ğŸ¤£ totally flatten by that animal horde 
Cause they actually got good super powers this time
Poor surprise attack 
Surprise attack got ran over
2 died
technicly
I would say â€œwhat about surprise attackâ€ but he will pull thru like literally every short heâ€™s on.
Bathtub living died, and so did surprise attack
Ikr!!! Finallyyyy
But what about Suprise Attack, since he got ran over? I mean yes, he didn't die because he can't but that has GOT TO HURT.

It aint a humiliation.
You should ask other creators and get sneak to appear on thier shorts.
Imagine the whole family coming after surprise attack for defeating two of there family members




And surprise attack getting surprised that he got a surprise visit
Honestly what surprised me the most was the fact that the heroes werenâ€™t totally useless
he got the villain too
How did he surprise you, he has the same face heâ€™s always had
well, it is surprisingly shocking
It wouldn't be a surprise if you could.

Reply 9
Lowkey surprise attack is OP af because you either have to be permanently paranoid of everyone being him and alert and expecting 24/7 or be surprise attacked.
"that's what she said." 

      Bro doin' his best.
â€œNow I'm getting pissed off!â€ â€œNo, now you're getting pissed on.â€ best lines I've ever heard this week
"It's Jubilee, the mutant that shoots fireworks out of her hands" "no, i'm Potpourri, i emit pleasant smells from my hands"
Not gonna lie, The ability to respawn as long as there is a bathtub in this world is really busted it's even more OP than Deadpool and Wolverines healing factor or regeneration.
"Surprise attack" is the most successful Superhero in killing and defeating his opponents. At least no SuperVillain has ever survived him.
The first time the heroes genuinely did a good job first try
â€œHmph, he went down fast. Thatâ€™s what she said.â€ 
That "it's time for backshots" out of nowhere is fcking hilarious
â€œNow I am getting pissed offâ€
â€œNo now youâ€™re getting pissed onâ€
Had me wheezing 
He's immortal and no one could predict his move. You can't ask for more powerful hero to defend this planet other than him
Bro surprise attack is getting violated fr
Surprise attack never fails to surprise me
Backshots is actually a great villain 
Every time he says his name his opponents
Are in shock
Now I'm getting pissed off!
No your getting pissed on
â€œIâ€™m Skunkbear, and this is Bathtublivingâ€ 
This is actually a really good opening round for the heros, 3 villains gone and only one hero dead, which doesn't even count that much since he will probably be back.
Surprise attack really surprised me in this one
This was the most creative surprise attack i have seen
"Now im getting pissed off "
"No, Now you are getting pissed on :D"
That actually wouldn't work, surprise attack said when you expect it, he won't attack, but then that means you know he won't attack and then he can
Â @HuladeliMonarchÂ  thatâ€™s what i mean, you have to expect to be attacked 24/7 or youâ€™ll be attacked. Imagine the fear, stress and paranoia slowly driving you insane if surprise attack wanted you dead, heâ€™s basically immortal.
He Isnt the smartest tho
He's actually terrifying
actually he can attack whenever, even if you're expecting him, because if you're expecting him that means you think you're safe hence his appearance would be a surprise. he's shown this feat before, so hes basically immortal no matter what you do.
He's too op.
Wdym "low-key"
surprise attack had been surviving impossible odds and straight up resurrecting
he really is the most op
so batman?
9 9 24
Thats like batman lol

Reminds me of Mel Brooks Robin Hood Men In Tights movie:
â€œPissed off?
If I were that close to a horseâ€™s wiener Iâ€™d be worried about being pissed onâ€
Yeah, since you can consider technically anything you can dip your body in to be a bathtub. So not just bathtubs, even a submerged cage under a lake is a bathtub. He's virtually immortal.
Â @phamquan8517Â  just like deadpool
â€‹Â @phamquan8517Â even if it has to be porcelain tub its still op. Especially with a fast respawn time like that.
Â @phamquan8517Â  I'd love to have that ability irl it'd be amazing.
These are some good heros lol
The only problem is that you would need to get back to the fight after dying if there isn't a bathtub nearby
â€‹Â @homerman76Â  no, I don't think he reapawns in the tub. I think he just gets back up
Space can be considered the bathtub of planets, as it holds everything, and you can dip into it.
â€‹Â @RuralNanoChaoÂ Yeah but you'll probably respawn way too far away, over and over.
imagine showering and looking behind you and you see some Deadpool cosplayer
I mean, it's technically immortality but with extra steps, since there is a way to kill you just very hard to do, could possibly be impossible depending on your definition of bath tubs. I would still take true immortality over it since having to respawn when you are defending someone might not be ideal.
And as long as you don't explain ur ability no one would know
Unless he respawns in a bathtub on the other side of the world
Respawn on the bathroom where girl taking a bath 
Bathloveliving more powerful than deadpool confirmed
What if someoneâ€™s using the bathtub he spawns in?
actually, there need to be at least 2 bathtubs as he said "bathtubs" not bathtube
fr, cuz deadpool can still die,  if he blows up, theres nothing left to regenerate, and wolverine, just heals fast, just kill him fast enough
But imagine he respawns in a bathtub with someone taking a bath
and there are millions
Not if you are in India
Space bathtubs
I mean if someone were to somehow shut down all water in pipes then they wouldn't be considered bathtubs anymore just giant porcelain pots.
â€‹Â @NAIXALAGÂ  I mean technically he spawned out of a bathtub with no water in it, though it might just be because the sign above them specifically labels them as "Bathtubs for sale" ğŸ¤”
Â @NAIXALAGÂ  You do realise that a bathtub doesn't always contain water, right?
Â @NAIXALAGÂ  no, the item was created with an intention and named. The name doesn't go away. hence why behind him are bathtubs not hooked to anything.
true
Suprised?
Â @MaxEG-i3wÂ No, but if one did survive that would be surprising making one survive but if its expected than itâ€™s not a surprise so his a paradox
â€‹@MaxEG-i3w ofc not that's the surprise
@MaxEG-i3wkind of
Surprise Attack is Mt favorite, just how he dies every time then the wonder woman music
I love how the villains genuinely sounded somewhat scared, they had the, oh shit, its John wick voice.
â€‹Â @x7temptest7x58Â  I love the comparison of Surprise Attack and John Wick.
Fr he killed all the villain at past
On the bad side, his fellow heros seem pretty successful in attacking him
Surprise attack always comes back because if he doesn't that wouldn't be a surprise anymore
Super attack is that one persistent shonen character that keeps getting beaten up
Always takes one for the team. Man of a man   
Fr he is goated
Yet, there is always a price to pay for surprising his enemies. He's literally bound by the laws of surpise 
No, and no one has actually managed to defeat him for good even tho, he's only been foiled by friendly fire
Ya but he also surpises himself
But no superhero too, you just wait.
Exactly
Explains why he has the grim reaperâ€™s weapon
True but its a shame he gets tortured every time he kills a villain
The legend
The myth
The guy

(not Expecto Patronum).
he doesn't survive himself as well.

i think surprise attack is protagonist in this series, and that mean the Truck-Kun is only beat surprise attack
I always expect Suprise attack
Fair
True but he mostly gets hurt in the process
Bathtub living and Skunkbear are is the only other superhero with a successful kill.
Killing an enemy while he is in flashback is the most powerful superpower
so true ma, he's like a cosmic level entity at this point
Â @xMonarch-d5vÂ nah he has normal level ap
SOO TRUUEE
Fr
Dude Is my favorites hero
Fr
True man he is my favorite
They did most of the time but they died in the end anyway
But heroes killed him
Legit better superhero than Marvel or DC classics. Definetly would watch a movie with him in it.
Yep
And also the unluckiest hero 
Fax
Actually, uhh, idk
Yes he is
Question. Can surprise attack Kill yogiri takatou?
â€‹Â @Th3KingZeroÂ Yep. Not even Yogiri is safe from the grim reaper itself, lol.
Surprise attacked
Perfect Prediction[PP] Started It all

yet he never survive himself XD
No super villain and super heroes has survived 
He is my favorite hero and he will never die 
And he immortal
Also the unluckiest
My favourite hero.
U agreed
i will be suprisd if he dont kill them but some ather did
SURPRISE ATTACK
Oof
But he always die
What if surprise attach attacks you normally without surprising you
Surprise attack is outversal
Surprisingly
also most deathed hero
But not to me
I remember that one Jumpchain I went to worm and mimicked Surprise Attack lol Jack Slash suddenly getting stabbed through the head while he doing a speech towards Panacea was  really funny
Unless the other do something dumb
High precision, low accuracy,
Fr
Cuz it's surprising
Agree
S
He always dies at the end
Yo
He also somehove  survirves everything
What about bathtub living and skunkbear, because they killed 2 villains and surprise attack got harly Ben
And no superheroes can't survive with him
he can't defeat his opponent fast because he always get in trouble by other hero
I got surprised
Why he always got kill
Or defeated him
I cast THUNDER




Abilityâ€¦ you surprised it wasnâ€™t Thunder SPELL? Surprise attack!
Unknown Superheros part 17 
on July 8th
Very few super heroes survive his support either.
Yet he always ironically gets "surprise attacked"
Just when you thought it's over, he's back at it again
Surprise attack!
Â @Roadrunner4life.Â  Damn, I didn't expect that
Only other superheroes make him lose
I mean everyone in this world look the same
"No villain has ever survived him" the problem is that he doesn't either
Â @FlamelordandDarkflameÂ  to be fair that has never been a problem
he's the most powerful bc he's immortal
Tea
Yea
surprise attack, sea man, skunkbear,bathtubLiving, and cringelord
they would be the best squad to defeat enemies
Immortality really gives him a advantage
Wait now that itâ€™s expected he canâ€™t do it anymore unlessâ€¦ itâ€™s unexpected
Yeah ngl this scene with him being in disguise and all was actually cool as hell
That's a surprise after all
He Has unlimited plot armour
Surprise attack: I always come back
Purple guy (or Williamâ€¦ idk): hey that my line?!
SupRiSE AtTaCK
Only thing is he gets hit by the other heroes
But he never survive too
He's immortal
And he is the immortal
Hes also the most successful in dying every time
ye suprise attack is the best and most succesful hero
He's never survived HIM either ğŸ¤£
He is legitimately considered in powerscaling.
The most surprising part of surprise attack... Is that he never gives up.
The second most successful hero is the cop. He doesn't do anything, never has a gun on him it seems, but he's survived after everything that's happened.
So true!!!
There was 1... villain who survived
No There is one who survived him And heâ€™s known as Obvious attackâ€¦..
And hes by technicalities. Hes immortal too
True
Suprise don't be -Barry Allen aka the flash
I gotta say, he'd be a pretty useful superhero.

Just as Thanos is about to finger snap...

SURPRISE ATTACK!!!
Police man is most powerful person to exist that doesnt get killed by him
Yeah, I want him a movie of his own, people will scream "HIS PLOT ARMOR IS CRAZYYYYY!! "
SURPRISE ATTACK!
Fr
Fr
It only takes 5 episode
He's just too op
they should make him a part of marvel or DC
he hasnt even survived himself
You're lying just say opposite what u you said
Fr
Surprise attack surprises everyone once again
His secret power is that heâ€™s immortal
Anti hero cuz he is killing
What's this song playing when he shows up ?
by being expected i become unexpected again when i do come out when i am expected
â€œOh youâ€™re a villain alright, just not a super one!â€
he fr could have been an actual superhero that could have had his own series after all his name is good enough and his way of defeating and attacking is interesting.
i had stroke reading yâ€™all comments
And he has not survived any of them
So true
His weakness is being surprised attacked.. 
WTF
Can we all agree that surprise attack is the best superhero in history

Fr
what is the song of suprise attack?
Wind guy got him
And he has never not died at the end
Youâ€™d be surprised
In fact, it would be surprising if he lost
Second powerful is a villain, which is backshot.
I know hes the only actual superhero but has the worst luck
The surprise is that it one taps no matter how strong you are
He also dies the most often, terrible K/D ratio
@Attaker-e8p suprised that your suprised because he dies a lot
Well guy with paper planes survived him
Bro has plot armor
FOR REAL
Greatest superhero of all time.
He's also died to every villain at least once
Only because the villains he fights are worse than him!

You know surprise attack is immortal so he will revive and attack you making it not a surprise anymore â€œme in the corner so it beginsâ€
So do any of them canonically die though because if they don't how am I supposed to feel involved in the storyline
Because they're Skunkbear and BathtubLiving 
not some random hero team up
I know! It's really....
What's the word?
Astonishing?
Unexpected?
Unforeseen?
Shocking?
Its at the tip of my tongue.
â€‹Â @DontObliteratetheCommenterÂ  Surprise attack!
Not to mention Surprise Attack's unexpected surprise
Bathtubliving and skunkbear had better abilities
Â @lawyer582Â no it kinda bad but they know how to use it like they are train properly
The tables have turned.
Â @xsarafobieÂ  And the turns have tabled.
To be fair. Some heroes are powerful but get screwed over.
Â @azikhan1707Â  Like the hero after biclops, iron man, and sea man
Iron man,sea man,guy in ep2 be like:
Exactly my thoughts
Hey give a shout out to iron man
5th k like of agreement for yoy
They team wiped!
Anything about my pfp,blud?
Â @InitiatorAllyÂ nope! :D
â€‹Â @InitiatorAllyÂ  horribld
â€‹Â @InitiatorAllyÂ Neat
The name itself implies
â€œYou canâ€™t say that without context-â€œ 
I'm still trying to figure out what the other meaning of that is.
You can't just say basho-     
-BACKSHOT
especially knowing the meaning
backshot!
wait, is that... a thing? what is a backshot?
Â @shilohmagic7173Â  u don't wanna know bro im telling u...
Bro Really Made a Gojo Joke lmao
â€‹Â @VixililyÂ thats just what the villain does, there aren't any references
Yea that one killed me lmao
Same bro

I died while laughing when he said that
Lol
R. Kelly

FR THOOO.
LOLed at that one so hard!
Honestly surprise attack gives me Kenny vibes from South Park
You also just described deadpool
Â @The-DraconianÂ you mean bathtubliving right?
â€‹Â @The-DraconianÂ  surprise attack literally bends reality to surprise people
But is he immortal if you expect him to be ?
HESS BACK
Â @Yarnaby-EditzÂ  and he's gone.
hes the best change my mind also to be honest i wasn't expecting that one either
Most OP characters
â€‹@The-0bserver  He is the strongest after all He's immortal, can surprise you,  might even be smarter than batman because he thinks inside and outside the box and breaks the fourth wall
better hero than all of marvel
Hands down my favorite super hero of all time
Best hero ever to exist.
Yes
And even now he still gets hit by his Allies attack 
The goat of unknown heroes is back boys
Now he is not surprising you because itâ€™s no longer a suprise
Best hero I never even suspected
Now we officially need a movie about him
He is the best but stupidest character in a nice way
I love this guy mobo needs to capitalize on it
Fr
He always comes back
Â @Tazdid_Â  hey! dont ruin the suprise! haha xD
He is the best superhero here
Agree
Ikr. I forgot that he always shows up in these. 
Surprise Attack is the best hero, no one can tell me other wise
Surprise attack deserves to be in a movie.
Surprise attack goat
The best one yet. Or ever.
Yeah, heâ€™s the best hero ever and he doesnâ€™t fail to surprise
Same
Yea
I'm saying
Yep
fr
Indeed
YUUUPP
Surprise attack
I somehow knew that was surprise attack immediately
True
True 
HE BACK
Best hero ever
He is now my fav hero now 
Yeee
i am so glad i didnt read your comment, i was suprised 
â€‹Â @John_36Â i agree with you!
Fr tho

Facts
Im proud of him, he got one villain.
YAY
You donâ€™t say
Wtf dude
Fr 
HOW DOES THIS GUY SURVIVE FOR EVER
Yup
lucky he is on the Heroes side.



or is it? 
*vsauce music played
frfr
True
Just like the spanish inquisition
Yh
Fr
Agreed
That's the point

HESSSS BACKKKKK
But he fails to live
Frrrr
Fr
I forgot the name of the song that plays when Surprise Attack showed himself
S
 so true
Best hero
surprise attack is getting surprised attack
Is Beast
Fr
It's in the name "SURPRISE" atack
Lolllll
me too
He really never does.
Then you are expecting to be surprised so you won't but your expecting that so you will, I need to think about this
W move ğŸ¤§ğŸ¤§
My fav hero now 
me too
Bro what's his theme sojg
Suprise attack back with the milk
SURPRISE ATTACK
I'm always happy to see him 
A movie for surprise attack would action so hard
Ur right
no more perfect 100 replies for you
Hey Marvel! If you have trouble shooting another movie, consider watching this. 
but he went down fast
Mate for once he fully surprised me I had no thought of his existence there
Suicide Squad killed themselves
my favorite super hero XD
are you really that suprised that attack didnt hit?
@linasjakobsen2852Â  I think it was more the appearance
i give people th power of 1k, goodluck
That kinda point
Why did u spoil
theeheeheeee
Back-shocks
me when jarate
The group is like the blue team then sunkbear is like a read sniper with a jarate
You're
What a surprise.
Surprise attack will be back, and more surprise
suprise attack canonically respawns if it is a suprise, which it always is
â€‹Â @squidman6463Â Because when it's not a surprise anymore, it's a surprise again.
â€‹Â @squidman6463Â  the only way surprise attack will be killed if everyone on earth will be killed because if he came back no one will be surprised anymore because everyone is dead. Right
Its basically a cheat this time. All 3 heroes are immortal.
Â @Porchy.Â  skunkbear doesn't seem to have immortality
Ok but seriously
I didn't expect him to be surprise attack
He really did suprised me
Maybe yall too?
Bro has either a, totems or b, is afton
Surprize attack has the ability to survive as long as it's a surprise
you got me
I was shocked when I saw his weapon!
i mean surprise literally is in his name so...
Fr though
i died
the R kelly move
Â @willowwinter8469Â oh no no no! LMAO
â€‹Â @willowwinter8469Â I don't think it's really R Kelly cause I don't think the villains are underage
"OOOOUUGHFH WHAT IS THIS?! D:<"
The way of the Outback Sniper

bro how did he got that amount of the Liquid 
"Now I'm getting pissed off"
"Now you're getting pissed on"
when you realize that surprise attack actually surprise you from no where 
Surprise attack is the real goat 
Surprise attack has to be my favorite. His power is whenever you're least expecting him he's there and you would never expect him because there's always a time when you would least expect him.
"Surprise attack" always gets half cooked in the end bro, he had every right to be a villain.
"Say what you will, but you are never prepared for the SURPRISE ATTACK."

-Sarah Dessen
â€œNow Iâ€™m getting pissed offâ€
â€œNo, now your getting pissed onâ€
Iâ€™m dying 
"That's right it's me, surprise attac-*gets dragged with the animals*"
When they needed them the most they returned
"Spiderman!?"

"No, I'm WebGuy"
"That's right it's me! Suprise atta-"
One of my favourite last words to date
Their comboâ€™s actually really good!
Surprise Attack being unironically surprising is something we need more
Surprise attack using his 0.1% power ğŸ¥¶ğŸ¥¶ğŸ¥¶
â€œNo,Your Getting Pissed On!â€ What A Quote Right There! 
"No, now you're getting pissed on."  Had me choke on my water bottle
The reason surprise attack will never fail is because mobo plays every single character himself, and in the  end he can Just reveal any random character to be surprise attack in a camouflage.
â€œNow youâ€™re getting pissed onâ€funniest guy ever
Seeing these superheroes actually winning for once actually fills me with joy
â€œNo , now your getting pissed onâ€ IS CRAZY
When the world didn't know them, THEY RETURNED
me too
Actually relatable
Thanks man, good thing I'm blind and deaf
Sniper tf2
Me when I watch the video and use the comment section
Bro when i watched this i was rolling off laughter bcs of that joke
His the Goat for sure!!!
Bro always catch a W, don't matter how many tries It takes.
And yet he chooses to be a hero despite knowing he possesses an overpowered ability.
â€‹Â @specter7221Â  the element of surprise
i have a theory he gets hit so he can make his enemies think he's gone and then his attacks will always be unexpected
Imagine he does become a villain
And yet he remains a hero
Maybe he knows the power of plot armor.
He's like the best unknown super hero in this universe.
Â @scarletrose8766Â  There should be a movie
Nah
-rosa parks
Suprise attack goes down so the villains dont expect him to be alive crazy theory
surprise attack if the enemy thinks heâ€™s dead itâ€™s perfect for a surprise attack if the enemy thinks heâ€™s alive, he will attack them in spirit form
125 likes and no comments,

Don't worry, he'll be back. He always is.
I was gonna say that ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
Thatâ€™s what she said
it'd be surprising if surprise attack takes control of another living person's body when he dies (like makima)
Iâ€™d imagine how suprise attack work if he a real heroes is his ability could change how people sees him untill heâ€™s attacking and it come undone. Basically assassin creed
Lmao 
That made me giggle 
Technically they always win with surprise attack beating the villain and dies immediately
Â @TheMan-eo2frÂ I think they mean the other heroâ€™s are not useless this time around
Technically they always won considering most of the time considering surprise attack beats the villains in the end and getting killed instantly
â€‹Â @TheMan-eo2frÂ and then respawns out of nowhere
Maybe they're not the protagonists in this one then
"Miles Morales!"

â€œItâ€™s time for backshotsâ€ got me dying and their reactions was hilarious
â€œNow iâ€™m getting pissed off- No, now youâ€™re pissed onâ€ killed me 
"Now I'm getting pissed off"
"No,now your getting pissed on"
Ok, BathtubLiving and Skunkbear are actually competent, or at least more competent than everyone we've seen so far with the exception of Surprise Attack.
Bathtub living has a pretty solid power ngl
Bro I didnâ€™t even know surprise attack was there ngl Gave me a real â€œSurpriseâ€
Actually got some guys that were actually useful this time.
"Suprise Attack" is my favorite hero out of them all he manages to show up in every single one andbit just makes my day whenever i see  him it just makes me happy and hearing him say his catchphrase "Suprise Attack!"
â€œNow Iâ€™m getting pissed offâ€
â€œNo, now youâ€™re getting pissed onâ€ 
"BathTubLiving" had me rolling bro
Surprise attack scared the hell out of me 
"No now your getting pissed on" is crazy
When they were actually doing good
Multiple supervillains in one fight, plus seeing unknown heroes get to actually be kickass and effective with their powers, plus a legitimately Surprising appearance!? I canâ€™t put into words how happy I am!
â€œIts HIMâ€
Surprise attack: Yep im him
"BathtubLiving" Got me dyingğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
"Now I'm getting pissed off"
"No, now you're getting pissed on"
Every line is literally killing me 
â€œNo, now your getting pissed onâ€ is crazy

â€‹Â @toboyaki_tagarakiÂ  but these two are the only superheroes team up so far that doesn't cause self sabotage. And they really know how to use their power too.
there is actually a plenty of super heros in this series that are actually pretty powerful (Bat man,two punch man,cringe Lord,gaulck,carman) but they either get screwed over by a tamemate or just simply outplayed
Â @abu_alsofÂ  cringe Lord has gof awful aim. But hes cool anyway
â€‹Â @abu_alsofÂ Seamen and dust man they also have good powers seaman got obliterated by hors lightning which was bad timed dust man got screwed over
Hor is slow but i didnt necessarily see him die in the episode so he still survived
Iron man?
Lmfao
Bro came back like a certain man who called himself a rabbit and is very shady
Same
Yeah but what is surprise attacks theme?
that's why he is named surprise attack
â€œSURPRISE ATTACKâ€
Â @AlwaysSleep.yÂ  literally
And the first time 4 villains got beaten in only one episode
3. The paper airplane guy managed to avoid the animals.
Surprised?
I mean he is surprise attack so
Huh
SURPRISE ATTACK
I'm happy but disappointed I mean when they work together they get defeated by 3 guys I mean we didn't even see King Sharts powers

i laughed so hard at "no,you're getting PISSED ON" plus the bucket throw was the cherry on top
Surprise attack is the best characters ever created
"Is time for backshots" that sentence had me on the floor 0:26
"Now Im Getting Pissed Off"
- "No, Now You're Getting Pissed On" :skull:
"no now your getting pissed on" got me dying
this man genuinely puts a smile a on my face
The cop facepalming in the background while Skunkbear and bathtubliving is introducing themselves is so relatable
The cop running away cuz he know some random azz superhero going at appear when he was there.
The fact that this version of Deadpool actually is immortal, cause there will always be bathtubs in the world 
When the world needed him, he returned. Surprise attack for the win!
YES FINALLY, UNKNOWN SUPERHERO SERIES RETURNS ITâ€™S BEEN TOO LONG 
"He went down fast"
Bathtubliving:that's what she said

â€œItâ€™s time for back shotsâ€ is crazy 
Can't believe bathtub living and skunkbear actually did something usually they'd already be dead
The ONE time I wasnâ€™t expecting Surprise Attack 
"He went down fast"
"That's what she said"
This was the best surprise attack yet. I legitimately went "Wait what?"
Bro surprise attack is my new favorite superhero
The disappointment on the officer's face.

"IM Skunkbear and he is bathtub living"
Skunkbear and Bathtub living actually makes a good team
He is better than what marvel is doing
Â @ChrisKetchersideÂ marvel need to be taking notes from Ian
And the most competent

:skull:
you guys know that...  wait nevermind
What if surprise attack actually summoned the heroes? This can be proven by the fact that the heroes are not what we expect, and also the fact that the ones that looks weak (like Iron man) is strong. Also, what if the cop was just a cover-up so people won't suspect that surprise attack was the one with the heroes?
Just make a new one.
the ocean is a bathtub
â€‹Â @CallMeMimi27Â 
Â @CallMeMimi27Â  nuuh
Imagine all the bathtubs got destroyed by a villain
Â @h20preston57Â  does ocean count as one?
but then what if you don't have a bathtub nearby and have to make a 10km jog back to the battlefield after respawning
Â @benhwa101Â   He mentioned "In the world" not nearby. So you could be in a city that has NO bathtubs at all, but since bathtubs still exist in a seperate city (Whether it be on the other side of the earth, or not) you can still respawn. Although, I really like the idea of you having to jog ALL the way back, and by the time you get there, the enemy, or your team, is already dead.
Â @benhwa101Â bro what is this minecraft??
Â @EvilrobotAMÂ  well he did come out from one so i think that's assumed
Portable Bathtub
No you're getting pissed on 
Not if I eat them all
Any tub or anything resembled as a tub (example: bath tub painting) as long as it is used for idea of bathing in theory should work?
That means bathtubliving has a pal that also is immortal
Surprise attack; the man of surprises
S
Suprise attack is weird becuse if he attacks more in one video its a suprise
What constitutes a tub
Â @greenmachine3723Â  anything that can hold human and water simultaneously
Mobo needed time to come up with the biggest surprise Surprise Attack for this video, to ensure that we'd be surprised

IT'S BEEN SO LONG

Surprise attack carries the series

Unrelated but does anyone know what Surprise Attackâ€™s theme is called
I did his job of doing a surprise attack
Same
However I wasn't surprised by his "death".
That's why it's a suprise.
Because you dident exempt him its been a surprise
Omg I'm like WHA ITS HIM
I agree with you on this
His power works

Surprising, isn't it

He appeared like he should have been followed with a "JO JO!!!!!"

"Surprise attack returns even more Surpriser"
Fr
I mean ain't it kinda the point?
Yeah!
In fact you will never expect him
Because since you expect him itâ€™s not a surprise so he wonâ€™t come but he still will because you expect that he wonâ€™t come because you ex left him to come
na wrd 
If you were expecting it then it wouldn't be a surprise attack
Â @RomanC2007Â  aha but since you know he will come you understand that itâ€™s a surprise and that he wonâ€™t come but when he does come itâ€™s a surprise because the fact that it wasnâ€™t a surprise made it a surprise again
You mean those buffalo? 
Reimoo

â€thatâ€™s what she saidâ€


top 10 best lines ever.
Skunkbear genuinely taken aback by Backshot (pun not intended) is hilarious lmfao
Sometimes I forget that he plays all the characters by himself 
"now I'm getting pissed off"
"No now your getting pissed on"

"IM GETTING PISSED NOW!"
"now your getting pissed on"

Ngl best superheroâ€™s so far. They actually took down the villains
Bathtubliving cracked me up so bad 
finally superheroes that turned out to be useful, aside from our favorite Surprise Attack. what a legend.
â€œIts HIMâ€ 

Lord surprise attackğŸ¥€
Surprise attack always dies at the end of the day as a true hero
The Now your getting pissed on got me 
Was the first and only hero to defeat villains
The DO OR DIE squad is so catchy Iâ€™m gonna have to steal that. Itâ€™s kind of like the phrase â€˜ride or dieâ€™

I cried when I heard that line
Itâ€™s  but also 

301th liked lol btw Christ be with you :)

â€‹Â @fal9973Â  why did bro put it in brackets ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£

Literally he is immortal
Each of them killed one
They had the upperhand
That wasnâ€™t surprise attack
I like how captain paper airplane is there even though he got rejected
These 3 could be a proper hero team.
Amazing Content!!
"It's time for BackShots" killed me ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
Bathtubliving got me rolling to Mars 
BathtubLiving sounds like a sims dlc
"You can't say it without context" bro knew what we thought about
"No, Now you're getting pissed on" got me rolling 
The Cop's power to always be in a situation where he has to be near a belligerent villain.
Love Surprise Attackâ€™s appearance at the end. 
BathubLiving is a mysterious  op power
"he went down fast" " thats what she said" caught me off gaurd 
â€œI have iron in my bloodâ€ -Hue Man
Surprise attack is unironically one of the coolest heroes
The goat is back baby! Surprise attack!
Surprise attack reminds me of Kenny from South Park. Always dies, but always comes back like a legend.
Wowâ€¦ Their powers are actually very useful this time and pretty overpowered for the bathtub guy. He will never die. You destroy an entire country worth of bathtubs and move on to another country? That first country is gonna start churning out bathtubs like crazy.
"No, now you're getting pissed on," is crazy work
The Suprise Attack Never Gets Old! my Favorite Hero So Far!..........

.
Well that explains why that random guy was just sitting at that table as a full battle happened, love the consistency

I also love how Surprise Attack's now been dethroned as the only competent hero
Damn bro, not pin?
He is late thatâ€™s why
Truly sad but thanks for your Donation 
Good one
My stomach produces acid.
It's seemingly the closest bathtub that he respawns in, so he's easy enough to imprison.
â€œOkay, now Iâ€™m getting pissed off.â€
â€œNo. Now youâ€™re getting pissed onâ€

> MEET THE SNIPER
I like how surprised attack even has
 A suprise song
Surprise attack, always surprise and no enemies kills him. He killed them, but every time he does it, I swear he also dies in the weirdest way, but the most sensible way.
Suprise attack never fails
Surprise attack be having the most kills in these series 
Surprise attack always saving the day
Surprise attack is really a top tier creation never fails to surprise me.
These unknown super heroes actually seem useful
Make surprise attack go through a character arc
The best serious comedy episode to ever exist
All hail Surprise Attack !!!!!!
Surprise Attack! The legend returns!
Suprise Attack is the strongest character in fiction
"No. Now you're getting pissed on." 
Suprise attack somehow has the best timing and the worst timing at the same time.
It's a shame Harley Ben died before even doing anything
bro the plot twists in this 
Respect him ğŸ«¡
The heros were acctually pretty affective in this episode
Skunkbear and Bathtubliving seen like a great duo
... Ahahaha hahaha it's his piss jar's isn't it
SUPRISE ATTACK
Dude has the power of immortality via surpise
â€œNo now your getting pissed onâ€ is crazy without context
These are actually pretty good heroes with helpful powers this time
There will never be a day where Suprise attack will fail a suprise attack.
The â€œ thatâ€™s what she said never fails to make me laugh lol
Suprise Attacks been the most reliable so far
Surprise attack.. He's back.. When the city needs him the most
R.I.P.
Backshot
King SharT
Harley Ben
You will probably not be remembered
Surprise attack should get a raise 
Surprise attack always dies in some wacky problem and backshot is kind of funny
Surprise attack is no joke the best one
"That's what she said"got me dying
No wonder the citizen wasn't afraid cuz he was surprise attack all along. Its truly always a surprise when it comes to surprise attack
Ngl not being able to die if there's bathtubs is OP af
The squirk on surprise attack's face when one of the doodoos said doo doo showed that surprise attack still remeber how he started surprising people!
Speaking of suprises, they have suprisingly good coordination.
Surprise attack is just iconic and I love him
Surprise attack always come in clutch when we need him most 
Imagine you get up in the middle of the night to find BathtubLiving just chilling in ur bath
Surprise attack need his own comic fr
"Surprise attack!"Dumbledore said loudly
Yeah I want to see more of them lol
Well a lot of the unknown heroes actually have good powers they just suck at using them or have terrible coordination
Iron Man did a decent job lasering the enemy but had terrible defense. If he teamed up with Captain Switzerland who doesn't attack but deflect attacks, they'd be the ultimate duo.

Sea Man did a good pretty good job too and could've won if it wasn't for Hor's terrible timing

Even Huge Jacked Man had a crazy cool ability. He's a pacifist sure, but if he could disarm the enemy's weapons, then the other heroes could have a better chance of winning.

Weed's smoke ability could've been helpful against anyone but Wack

Shanty and the 6 dings reviving heroes was super helpful. If only he revived the competent ones.

No Vision's only downside is that he had no way of directly attacking someone who could shoot out wind. 

Even Cringelord's cringe inducing rays are pretty good at pacifying or subduing enemies.
Â @nobodys_here07Â  Exactly, if these heroes were just more competent and better at working together instead of accidentally sabotaging each other, they would be a pretty powerful superhero team
We'll see about that

"Suprise attack"
 
"Famous last and first word"
"It's me, suprise attac-" gets fudging rhinoed.
ITS TIME FOR BACKSHOTS
Ofc the ONE SINGLE TIME I wasn't expecting surprise attack, he comes
When I saw the BathtubLiving jacket my first thought was "MATPAT!?"
I love how the cop isnâ€™t doing anything just letting the heroes take the risk
Suprise attack never fails to successfully fail
Surprise attack? 
Surprise attacked 
Surprise attack always surprises me, it's his job
Surprise Attack needs his own movie
I swear surprise attack needs his own movie
his videos never fail to amaze me lol
Surprise attack always comes back even if you kill him
Dude, you are my favorite comedian... like ever. Modern superheroes failed me, these will never. Extremely happy to see your still producing. Also thank you guys for the 27 likes, that's a lot for me
â€œItâ€™s time for Backshotsâ€ is a crazy sentence. Good thing he added capitalization
wolverine and deadpool

fanboy and chumchum
"Suprise Attack " ğŸ«¡
*"No, youre getting pissed On"*

The "it's time for back shots", had me crying on God lol
"That's right, It's me Surprise Attack."

Gets Fricking OBLITERATED
I mean he already got a 4 minute backstory
It would be better than what Marvel has been making.
I love that surprise attack is always unlucky
â€œNo now your getting pissed onâ€ 
Yknow....these two are actually pretty damn useful, like Skunkbear could legit be a serious character
They surprisingly handled it well
Surprise attack is so original and so "SURPRISING"ğŸ¤«
Bro, surprise attack deserves a hq series.
The time when supprise attack lived upto his name 
â€œIs she with youâ€ went perfectly with that last clip.
Look, itâ€™s deadpool! No, itâ€™s Bathtubliving
3 heroes that actually did the job, noice.
Bathtubliving for Deadpool is pretty genius.
No. Now Your getting pissed on, is comedy gold 
This time they fr got useful
Mo never fails to surprise  me with his unknown  super hero episodes  and the humor  its funny 
Usually the many heroes were needed for one villain, but this time it was the other way around
The cop has an ungodly amount of plot armour
These might actually be the most useful heros so far.
This is the most competent the unknown superheroes have EVER been
When the heros are actually good at there job
â€œIâ€™m getting pissed off. No your getting pissed onâ€ got me dying
Give me vibes like Kenny from South Park dies in almost every video and yet by the next he's perfectly alive fit as  a fiddle
Its because its surprising how he ends up dying
He's the spiderman of this universe
No it's because of his surprise magic, right know he does only know the surprise attack but his magic make it so the surprise in his attack has to get back, making him nearly invulnerable since attacking him would instantly allow him to surprise attacking you from a distance because it's when you think that he is in danger and can easealy be killed or forget about where he is that his active surprise magic can be used
SUPRISE ATTACK
Â @MaximusTheGreat5Â  oh noooooo
They are learning
â€‹@anzeigefehler6495  nah just some good heros
agreed
It's so good to see the guys back in action honestly I love this series.
The dude with the most plot armour is the police 
No now youâ€™re getting pissed on is a wild comeback
Bathtubliving can be a name of an indie bedroom rock band 
" no, now your getting pissed on " got me 
These superhero powers are actually quite op
Surprise attack always manages to give a surprise
police man has seen enough
AYO the heroes are getting good at their jobs! Or at least good powers. 
Either way good in them!
"that's what she say," ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
Yessss!!! Surprise Attack is back! Love this series! Also Suprise Attack is the most smart and successful super.
"no, now your getting pissed on" 
These names he comes up with are hilarious  I'm Skunkbear, and he's Bathtubliving ğŸ¤£   "Surprise Attack," doesn't stay alive long enough for me 
That's the first time Surprise Attack actually surprised me since the start of the series  (I love this series!)

He needs a movie!
Somehow they kill the villain faster when the villain are not alone
The Fear in The Leaders Eyes when he realises it's The Goat Suprise Attack.
I can't believe I did it I watched all 170 of His YouTube Shorts ğŸ¤£
I love your videos man, keep it up, One Thing I Love The Most Is The That's What She Said Jokes ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
I expected the villains to all lose at ep 5. Maybe the main villain will just call worse and worse villains every episode
Can we discuss about the fact that itâ€™s the first time more that one hero survive to the episode ? Like.. surprise attack always survive but, livingbathtub and Skunbear with Gopu are still alive and useful at the end of the episode ?
Backshots and surprise attack are my forever favourites 
"Am getting pissed on but no your getting pissed on" Got me 
This series should never end
The fact that the cop has become famous for having all the heroes
He went down,that's what she said.

Such inspiring words....... 
BathtubLiving is overpowered, man's literally immortal unless the planet is destroyed
0:33The"thats what she said"
Surprise attack is genuinely my favorite superhero
"surprise attack never dies" goes hard
I swear the cop has the power to summon superheroes out of thin air
Skunkbear saying "blub" instead of Wolverine's usual "bub" was a nice touch
No kinds of Villains have ever defeated Surprise Attack........................ but the Hero did
Those 3 are my new favorite
SURPRISE ATTACK!!
â€œHe just killed surprise attack, YOU BASTARD!â€
Surprise attack is an actual goated superhero
yall CANNOT presume surprise attack dead EVER
â€œItâ€™s time for back shotsâ€ gets me all the time it is so funny
0:52 i kinda expected it ngl
Surprise attack is the most iconic of heros
â€œNo, now your getting pissed on.â€

â€œâ€
Thank for this much likes 
I kept laughing for 30 seconds
agree
At this point all the heroes are basically his brothers
No, he'd just respawn on another planet that also just so happens to have bathtubs
That power's kinda useless unless there are bathtubs nearby. Also it doesn't really help in fightning.
Â @NotaPlagueDoctor300Â  Not nearby its as long as it exits and as for fighting he can maybe make the enemy use up their energy
surprise attack is overpowered, he's immortal even if the planet is destroyed
@RealHeresJeffyREUPLOADYT wdym she has disguise
@RealHeresJeffyREUPLOADYT I just never knew Surprise Attack was female
which is better than immortality
still bad but you atleast dont just wait in the eternal void forever
Â @apel66sinkaÂ  true
â€œHow?â€
Same here
me two
Which makes him also a superhero.
I guess he's a summoner class
THANK YOU I HAVE ALWAYS NOTICED THIS
Fr bro is everywhere lol
So it's not a surprise, you predicted SurpriseAtack
Suprise attack's so great that he is drinking coffee in middle of a destroyed city
"I am gonna defeat you villians!" 
"No you won't"
"We'll see about that"
timer appears in the corner
"It's time for backstop"
"No your getting pissed on"
Got me

At least the heroes were actually useful this time lol
"Now I'm getting pissed off"

"No, you're getting pissed on"

Killed me
Suprise attack has to be the main character 
Bro surprise attack actually surprised me
"No you're getting pissed on" lmao this guy is too good.
We need a feature film for surprise attack
Surprised attack is so funny ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
"NOW IM PISSED OFF"
"Nah your getting pissed on " got me ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
Backshots got me dieing 
No now you're getting pissed on is an epic line
"No now you're getting pissed on is crazy"
â€œGet pissed onâ€ got me
what's the music from suprise attack's segment?
Itâ€™s great to see the cop finally got competent heroes that are t Surprise Attack
Bathtub living is freaking killing me
this bro is really talented , imagine you playing multiple roles all by yourself
"Now youre getting pissed on" is insane
backshot*
you're*
I got so off guard 
Bro thinks hes R kelly
I'd be more surprising if he wasn't
The cop is the mc
â€œâ€
Surprise attack NEEDS an training arc to detect better the danger around him
BathtubLiving man I canâ€™t with this 
Bathtub living kinda op ngl
This is peak and always will be
BathtubLiving absolutely killed me 
Surprise attack made me chuckle.
Im WAAAY to invested in this   I legit was excited when surprise attack appeared
Deadpool is like Bedwars, whoops I mean bathtubliving
The Police Officer and Surprise Attack are iconic at this point, I think they might start hopping into other shorts by this guy
Bathubliving is so OP tho
I promise bro surprise attack is now so iconic that it IS now a original hero
"They went down fast, that's what she said" got me rolling
"Now I'm getting pissed off," "no now you're getting pissed on" goes hard
surprise attack LITERALLY surprised me
That time suprise attack was actually a surprise
literally I always donâ€™t expect suprise attack
The cops solo all he can summon any super heros 
â€œItâ€™s time for back shotsâ€ 
The time they get so close to the feeding dumb and they lose
this was prolly the most sucessfull episode for the heroes.
Surprise attack strikes again
He really did it!
BathtubLiving has to be the best thing all of us have from these series so far!!! 
The cop disappointment behind the heros 
â€œNow it is time for back shotsâ€ got me on the floor
surprise attack is the hero that always appears in videos but still surprises us
"Time for backshots" is insane (free diddy party)
The only time surprised attack was surprising
Surprise attack really cooked with this one
Yes itâ€™s me surprise attaâ€¦ 
Got me LMAO
This is the first time som one is usefulness then surprise attack
Surprise attack should be the best hero because he always comes in clutch
The origin of surprise attack really surprised me back then 
The back shots the most powerful weapon
Surprise attack never ceases to surprise me 
the original NUNUNINUNUHNUH on suprise attack is so  awsome
Surprise attack is now an officially known hero
"no your getting pissed on" is just crazy
These guys are actually competent
He's in every freaking video and he still catches me off guard. Lmao. Most successful hero for sure.
This is the first time their powers actually useful
Finally, we have some actually effective superheroes.
I am dying,My mission is over now>>>
"That's what she said" caught me off guard 
Surprise attack GOT suprise attacked
It got me laughing so much time 
Surprise attack is an all time classic
At the last second got me DYING
Surprise attack just got surprise attacked
i love how this time the heros were actually competent and didn't completely mess up like always 
â€œHe went down fast.â€ 
â€œThatâ€™s what she said.â€
Out of everything they've done this the only one I've seen them win
The one time I wasnâ€™t expecting surprise attack
I would love to make an animated show wirh these superheroes
So far out of all the ones you have done this one is my favorite we need more super villain / superhero content
You know surprise attack will always surprise me




But it won't surprise me if bro gets jumped by random objects or an attack
Was neat to see the Doods working with another.
"Surprise attack" is too powerful. He even surprised Himself 
no now you getting pissed on had me rolling
Stunkbear in a bathtubliving
Since not even the fans expected surprise attack it became an even better surprise attack 
And honestly looking back at this those two were good ones since they did something useful
Bathtubliving is the funniest thing i heard all day
Now Iâ€™m getting piss off no your getting piss on got me dying on the floor 
Dude actually good super heroes this time man. And one extra to
Suprise attack is basically just â€œI diedâ€¦BUT THEN I LIVEDâ€ incarnate
These three are some of the strongest
Suprise attack is the funniest charecter and always the most unlucky
''Bathtub living ''
BathtubLiving is lowk goated because there's bathubs all around the world. He should do good in the next unknown superhero episodes
Surprise attack: I always come back
suprise attack needs an oscar for living any attack in human existence even in the ocean and also in space
i cant believe that was surprise attack this whole time he really surprised me
bathtubliving is actually overpowered on city level villains
THAT TIME WHERE IT SAID IM GET PISSED OFF THEN BRO SAID NO YOUR GETTING PISSED ON LOL
Skunkbear and bathtub living is accually fucking golden 
The pause and skunkbear's reaction to hearing "back shots" got me dying 
â€œ no now youre getting pissed ONâ€ LMFAO
Skunkbear and bathtub living is crazyvlol
I love how surprise attack always dies at the end and comes back 
itâ€™s time for back. Shot is crazy though. 
Those were the only goods skilled heroes and Surprise Attack was flattened
Surprise attack got surprise attacked 
The 'Now im getting pissed of, no you're getting pissed on' got me lmao
The Plot twist was crazy
Surprise Attack looking down as he realizes the Do or Die squad is back is actually a pretty good forshadowing if you think about it
the surprise attack theme music is legendary
that last one catch me surprised
â€œSurprise attackâ€ is the best character
Surprise attack should have an anime to his name, such a legendary character
They actually doing great this time
Know your getting pissed on
The suprise attack theme is fire ngl
I think this trio would be useful for fighting villains
Ah deadpool and wolverine my favourite fox characters
surprise attack deserves his own series
Bro this IS the comeback we all waiterd for! THE HEROS FIGHT BACK
"Now you're getting pissed on" Got me laugh. Help I can't breathe
Surprise attack is unironically the most genius hero ever
Bro the one liners are killing me 
Surprise attack is the most powerful hero among them but the other ones always kill him before he can make the final fight
Surprise attack needs his own comic
The way that the 911 guy moved back down looking disappointed seeing them again
Itâ€™s me. Suprise atta-. Got me dying.
Bathtubliving ğŸ«¡
Surprise attack is my favorite in these videos
skunkbear and bathtub living  - just from that im dead lol
Bathtubliving is low-key op. Thatâ€™s near infinite lives right there
Surprise attack surprises me every time
Outside of Surprise Attack Skunkbear guy actually defeated multiple villains at once.
"Now I'm getting pissed off!"
No, Now your getting pissed on" broğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
Surprise attack is my favorite and I never see him coming
Surprise attack is genuinely successful despite the circumstances every time 
PISSED ON 
This â€œbackshotsâ€ character is hilarious
â€œI am the spy from Team Fortress 2.â€

-Surprise Attack, 2025
I like the fact he searches himself in the "its a pheromone that attracts animals to attack" section
surprise attack got surprise attacked lmao
Everybody talking about surprise attack but never about backshots, he's scary
Skunkbear and Bathtubliving actually have op powers ngl
"Now you are getting pissed on" ğŸ¤£
I just realised that a drawback to Suprise Attack's power is that he keeps getting suprise attacted. Its more like he is a center of some force which he neither fully understands or controls.
The cop and surprise attack, da duo's
Surprise attack 
Now im getting pissed off. No, now you're getting pissed on! Got me rolling
"That's what she said" bro that is wild
even pridected one wouldn't try bc he would just hear his predictions then do something else
i swear surprise attack is op
The first time both heroes actually accomplished smth
â€œThat's what she saidâ€ 
"Huh. He went down fast."
"That's what she said."

DAMN BRO
Did anyone notice that bathtub living did not flinch when backshots said "its time for backshot"?
Bros just drinking his coffee an explosion happen
"now im getting pissed off.." 
"No... Now your getting pissed on!!"
Surprise attack is the only one who actually wins here in some way 
Finally the op unknowns win
"You went down fast, "that's what she said
That bathtub superpower is oddly specific.
Bathtubliving would actually be goated ngl
the most unexpected series that you expect content from everyday:
The only hero's that actually defeat the villains
THE LEGEND IS BACK SUPRISE ATTACK
"Now I'm pissed off" "No now your getting pissed on" got me rolling on the floor
Heros did good this time, 2 hits and a surprise attack on villains, and surprise attack was the only one hit
This guyâ€¦ is the perfect comedian
I think suprise attack needs a movie.
Well, off to visit your mother.

-Surprise Attack
God, these are so dumb! I just canâ€™t get enough of them. Keep it up!
This guys are the first guys I saw defeat their enemies so fast 
The first time i wasnâ€™t expecting surprise attack
Surprise attack always gets surprised 
Surprise attack is the best superhero
We need a whole movie about surproae attack being the main hero now.
Crazy how the heroes that showed up were actually effective.
Lowkey tell me why those two were cooking them 
I would love to see an official series on surprise attack and the absolute horror he would be to anybody that is considered evil
"That's what she said" killed me
The surprise attack has breached our defenses.
Best line backshot hahaha
surprise attack is the GOAT
The first time that the hero's are winning
Suprise attack literally never gets a break, he always gets run over or beat up or something  poor guy, at least he always actually gets things done though
i laughed too hard on "now you're getting pissed on"
Bathtubliving and suprise attack are extreme threat
If bathtubliving know how to use his power which is extremely hard to defeat and suprise attack already reached his peak
These DO.O.D.S are awesome!
This time these unknown superheroes ACTUALLY got the job done 
finally good heros
Bathtub guy's power is broken tho
Thats what she said 
Surprise attack ICONIC 
'thats what she said'' got me
This is the real super hero weâ€™ve been waiting for return 
Wow these heros actually are effective this time lol
The Surprise Attack is the only actual good superhero who actually survived
Suprise attack, most effitient hero that gets screwd by being around other heroes
When the suprise attack theme song was on, theres always be a bad thing happend
These three heroes have been the most successful yet.
Surprise attack just attacked the right person at the wrong time.
Called surprise attack from the start
Surprise attack sacrificing himself for the world 
Surprise attack always surprise me
The fact that the cop is the only one who isnâ€™t a npc (aside from surprise attack)
Atleast they killed most of the villains
"your not getting pissed off your getting pissed on" caught me of gurad
This is abosulote cinemaIt got me rolling straight to mars
Now your getting pissed on is just wild
Surprise attack is literally the best ever
Suprise attack is the most successful hero by killing all villains and then literally become the hero filled with bad luck
Ngl Bathtub Living is overpowered
Finally useful heroes for once
That actually went rather well all and all
I love how currently backshot is the strongest villian because his power is a gun
"it's time for Backshots  is crazy"  
â€œNow Iâ€™m getting pissed offâ€

â€œNo. Now your getting pissed onâ€ 

My favorite quote 
Surprise attack learned a new way to make sure we donâ€™t notice him making it a surprise because everyone has the same face
No you're getting pissed on 
Adding on to the comment below me, if he was a supervillain, we'd be cooked
â€œI will always respawnâ€¦*gets into a stance* now itâ€™s my turnâ€¦â€ I love it I canâ€™t stop watching this
The heroâ€™s in this actually did something successful. And Surprise attack is BACKKKKKKKKK
Surprise attack never fails to surprise us
Surprise Attack never fails to surprise
They both had pretty good powers
Surprise attack never Fails to Surprise me
Backshots is crazy 
This is why surprise attack is my favorite
Cop face palming after hearing skunkbear and bathubliving names lol
â€œNow Iâ€™m getting pissed offâ€ â€œno now your getting pissed onâ€
"He went down fast"
"That's what she said"
Surprise attack always get surprised and attacked 
â€œAll your city are belong to usâ€
That scythe has seen better days
Honestly these are pretty useful
â€œNow Iâ€™m getting pissed of. no your getting pissed onâ€
Nah I love how the villains are as scared of suprise attack as they would be with batman
pretty op powers actually
The city finally actually got some good heroes this timeâ€¦ or heroes that donâ€™t clash too hard at least
â€œNow Iâ€™m getting pissed off.â€ â€œNo, now youâ€™re getting pissed onâ€ BRO 
Thatâ€™s what she said caught me off guard
That could be a real show
This is the best series ever
â€œYeah itâ€™s me, Surprise Atta- *gets ran over*â€ got me dying to America
Suprise attack is the most "compitent" out of the bunch 
bro said no now you're getting pissed on lmao
Bathtub Living is goated
I actually loved this episode
Not the wonder woman theme after Surprise Attack ğŸ¤£
"Blub" 
Surprise attacked got surprise attacked
I just realized besides surprise attack skunkbear and bathtubliving are the only heroes to ever take down a villain
Surprise attack always gets surprise attacked
I feel bad for surprise attack getting hit in one way or the other but he is still the best character in this series
â€œYou canâ€™t say that without conte-â€œ BACKSHOTSâ€
The ONE time he got a W
sutprise attack gets surprise attacked as often as he surprise attacks
Marvel needs to take notice and make a movie dedicated to Surprise Attack
This is the most successful knock off hero duo, and they acutely are useful and they lived
â€œNo, youâ€™re getting pissed onâ€
"Ha that's right it's me surprise atta-" and then him getting run over by the animals got me rolling down the stairs rotflmao
Poor surprise attack man can't catch a break
Bathtub living is quite a unique ability actually...
In my opinion, these unknown heroes actually have the strength to fight 1 vs 1, and they can't control their power when they are in a team.
Suprise attack solos fiction
"What are we? Some kind of do-or-die Squad?"
Surprise attack should really stop being surprised that he gets killed every time
time for back shots is crazy
Now your getting pissed on  best part
Two heros that were actually good
Its in character for Deadpool/Bathtub Living to say â€œThats what she saidâ€
Suprise attack wont work bc every one expects him to suprise attack which isnt suprise attack anymore.
it's time for back shots got me
That surprise attack
Suprise attack 
Sudden death 
It is time for back shots is wild
No, youre getting pissed on got me rolling all the way to Mars
Surprise attack has the worst luck but even his luck cant find him till he accually does a surprise attack
plot twist:the cop has the oly god power to create random heros in danger untill he is safe
I love BackShots !!
Can't we talk about that the cop littertaly had more plot armour than anyone there he didn't even die or gotten hurt once
"surprise attac-" ahh surprise attack man
YOO THIS IS PEAK COMEDY I'M LIKE DYING RN
Can we appreciate how good of a superpower BathTubLiving has?
The only counter for surprise attack would be to expect absolutely everything
"now im getting pissed off"
"no."
"now you're getting pissed on"
Surprise atack is the MC of this universe 
That jacket is perfect for that one sipder man suit i forgot what it was called
Surprise Attack needs a raise bro

Every Single time he manages to kill/actually hit a villain every single time without fail and he always manages to find clever ways to disguise himself to surprise the villains every single time and also how is that dude even alive almost every single time he shows up right after surprise attacking someone he always somehow gets hurt like when the rhinos runs into him and cant forget the time when cringe lord shot him
can we be happy that the heroes are actually useful
Now Iâ€™m getting pissed off, now youâ€™re getting pissed on.
â€œItâ€™s time for backshotsâ€ and â€œNow Iâ€™m getting pissed off-â€œ â€œNo, now youâ€™re getting pissed onâ€ are some of the funniest lines Iâ€™ve heard in this series so far
SURPRISE ATTACK Goes hard
I need more of this i swear
Back Shot is diabolical. EFFIN GENIUS!!! LMFAO!!!! Wonder how many times that got a "NO!!!" in the 90's.
"backshot' got me
Imma be real, the unknown superheroes actually did really good this time. Even Surprise Attack pulled up!
"Now im getting pissed off"
"No now your getting pissed on"
Got me
ğŸ¤£ These are my favorite videos!
Sink near and bathtub living are actually kinda broken in this universe
Bathtub living and surprise attack could be a good combo, like imagine surprise attack resurrected in the bathtub instead of bathtubliving and bathtubliving actually resurrected in the far away bathtub
Skunkbear has the superpower that works lol I can see the cop saying finally hahah one that worked right hahahaa
Blue the creatur's imagination was unlimited he can make every thing become a hero 
The prophecy foretold the return of surprise attack, the great defender
I like surprise atak  w surprise atack
Wait.. is the cops super power to summon weird unkown villians when threatened?
nobody can defeat surprise attack except for a hoard of animals
Nro surpise attack is getting killed so many times
Canâ€™t believe they did a teamup
This time i didn't expect Suprise attack
The guitsr riff for surprise attack is the best, i dont remember what its from tho ngl
Make a hero that heals a randon person
this dude is so funny i love his videos
"haha yes im suprise atta- *Gets ambushed" Got me rolling on the Air 
no way I have have the same black mug
No your getting pissed on is wild
Suprise attack's the G.O.A.T superhero
Surprise Attack is lowkey a great superhero.
Surprise Attack is the Schrodinger hero. You're expecting him to attack and not expecting him to appear at the same time.
At least this time surprise attack took jester with him 
This is the first time heroes actually win
Do or die reminds me of die of death
bedroom villains vs bathroom heroes
â€œNow ur getting pissed onâ€
Surprise Attack the goat
they didnt even arrive and the citys infastructure was already breaking down
Surprisingly, the heroes were effective in taking out their villains.

And they have actual useful powers!
I like to think that the police officer was having lunch with surprise attack and just got back from the restroom
Surprise attack is stranger than the whole marvel dc and invincible universe
"It's time for backshots" sent me reeling. HOLY RANDOM That was so funny wtf
Producer: â€œHow many plot twists would u like?â€
Mobo:â€YESâ€
Bro Bathtub Living might be OP
The funny part is the unseriousness
the super hero names sound like gamertags
Suprise attack could lit solo them all if he wasn't needed by all his allies
Bathtubliving is surprisingly op there are like 1 billion bathtub in the world so unless the world ends then he will keep respawn
Goodbye Tweek, 
Yep, not allowed in heaven.
Surprise attack just had bad luck
This was great this one
How is no one mentioning the â€œ no your getting pissed onâ€ it had me dying
OK. I legit didn't expect surprise attack this time.
why is no one talking about how Suprise Attack himself got a taste of his Æ¡n medicine?
Surprise attack is the best of them all
The first time i saw suprise attack actually suprise attack someone 
Imagine coming back to life and the first thing you say is "that's what she said"
Surprise attack is a paradox that you can't beat
if you don't expect him to attack, he will surprise you
if you DO expect him, he will still attack you which is a surprise
For once it was actually a surprise
This time superhero,s are really good
I'm pretty sure the only reason surprise attack cames back is because it's a surprise that he came back.
Watching this the second time after a year and just now got the joke with DeadPool and BathtubLiving
"im getting pissed of"
"nah ur getting pissed on" 
I actually didnâ€™t expect him for once
we need surprise attack in avengers doomsday
Surprise attack has the most potential but he always gets targeted by other heroâ€™s, If he was alone he would easily solo all of the villains
imagine if surprise attack was a villain all this time, and that was his ultimate surprise attack?
Surprise attack was the only hero to kill the villains 
Nah.... Did he just say getting pissed on and backshots
"you can't say that without context!"
surprise attack could beat all of fiction.
Suprise attack gets surprise attacked
Surprise attack is good. The problem is, he is always getting surprise attacked
They are actually the best 3 heroes of this series i think
fr they should make a movie about surprise attack's origin story.
The cop is actually a hero that summons random shitty heros when in danger
Ngl bathtubliving and skunkbear were actually good
"that's what she said" pause
Suprise attack its the most powerful one yet
Bathtub living im crying 
Surprise Attack too OP
ive definitely been surprised
This time surprise attack worked 
Surprise attack got surprised attacked
The heroâ€™s actually did something useful for once
I my god i dont if i should laugh or angry with all this puns they are all good and bad in the same time ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
Surprise attack got surprised attacked
Even Uploaded on My birthday
Bro should be acting in Marvel
Surprise attack is my fav
Surprise attack has highest plot armor and lowest plot armor bro
Pissed on is crazy
I lost it right after he said "skunkbear and bathtubliving" and never recovered 
Finally, Heroes manages to stop the Villians for the first time, with Surprise attack, actually surprising attacking the jester.
â€œNo now your getting pissed onâ€
First time it went so well
Wow, the heroes actually had good powers who would have thought
bro this whole thing got me rolling on the floor
Man this shi is funny ğŸ¤£
â€œNow Iâ€™m pissedâ€ no now your getting pissed ONâ€
My favourite hero of all time suprise attack 
At least these unknown superheros are pretty strong
Suprise Attack is both the strongest of Mobo's Heroes and a World Class Spy
finally my goat got a kill surprise attack for life
The imortal surprise attack
More like the surprise got a surprised
Surprise attack every ep:Guess whoâ€™s back back again guess whoâ€™s back tell a friend
Villain: now I'm getting pissed off
Skunkbear:no your getting pissed on
It would be funny if Skunkbearâ€™s attack did nothing since thereâ€™s no wild animals in a city and itâ€™s just an awkward silence
love how Skunkbear said Blub instead of Bub
wow some superheros with some good skills xD the scunk power is pretty cool. and bathtub man or what ever is OP xD
actually pretty good heroes this time
"surprise atta-" gets squished
''skunkbear and bathtubliving"GOES VIRAL
BRUH HOWW  i watched wolverine and dead pool movie earlier and here it is
Ngl surprise attack might be an ok superhero tbh
Best channel to comedy. you are the best mobo
Let's go it's the GOAT.
I swear that if every hero except for suprise attack died he would just kill everyone in a single episode
you can see surprise attack already has his costume inside hum
Lmao doodie was right there  ğŸ¤¦â€
In the end the surprise attack got a surprise attack
What is the surprise attack theme
do-or-die squad unironically being a better name than s*icide-squad
Surprise attack is boundless according to the r/powerscaling subreddit
Pissed on is crazy
Dudes is a hard superhero team name 
"but there will be bathtubs i will always respawn"

"Ahh moment"
Surprise attack finnaly got one
Yo bathtubliving and skunkbear are actually carrying
It's like King's ability from One Punch Man. Just like the King in chess, all possible friendly pieces will always move to save and protect him, warping fate itself to guide them to him. In the event there's no friendly pieces, and there's no enemy king tier piece nearby, he will surrender them as well by aura alone.
imagine one of the villians almost got hit by a car then suprise attacke saved him then suprised attack him after saying your welcome
Surprise attack always gets surprise attacked wheather itâ€™s by friendly fire or running animals
how come surprise attack always get killed
Surprised attack never dies
Wait does that mean there are two heroes with claws? (a.k.a Hugh Jacked man and Skunkbear)
Love surprise attack 
I KNEW IT
"Now you're getting pissed ON"
"Suprise attack , hmmp that's right it's me Suprise attack "  *proceeds to get surprise attacked * ğŸ¤£
The most unhinged IAmMoBo viseo
bathtub living is like surprise attack he's immortal too
Bro missed the fact that he can called the Deadpool fake as "LivingTub".
Surprise attack always getting suprise attack 
ngl having a power where your immortal aslong there's 1 specific object that's everywhere around the world seems cool.
I actually expected suprise attack as the random guy cause this guy doesnt show random people only heroes
Bootleg Deadpool, bootleg wolverine and surprise attack
Pissed on
Thatâ€™s what she said is crazy
He surprised attack someone and then he got surprised attack
suprise attack! the best one so far
Villain:-She went down too fast 
Bathtub:- thats what she said 
Bro why r those 2 heros powers actually kinda useful 
Bro, surprise attack is a better hero than most on the big screen  no lie
Bathtubliving and skunkbear
Surprise attack is honestly the best super hero
Surprise attack is my favourite
ugh now Iâ€™m getting pissed off no now your getting pissed on Got me rolling on the floor
He ALWAYS come back
Surprise attack is the strongest in the hero team and he could surprise anyone with one shot kill
imagine that u acciedentally make the most well written smart interesting hilarious generous superhero that ever existed and had the most creative and op and the best ability anyone in fiction ever had
I hear words, even though they are unheard.
Well, that's pretty successful fight
Well there always bathtubs he doesnâ€™t die lmao best super power every
BRO IN THE END! 
Suprise attack is the coolest
Surprise attack is the most powerful being in the universe. No villain has and will never took him down. He has defeated 3 villains so far. And will defeat more
Surprise Attack is my favorite
Surprise attack is literally the best hero
Surprise attack the worlds best spy, and the worlds best injury attraction
This is better than normal super heroâ€™s!
"Surpise a doom"
SA or Surprise attack is my favourite hero in this series
I am convinced that he is Suprise Attacked
He shouldâ€™ve call the off brand Wolverine r Kelly, it wouldâ€™ve worked too
So probably the first heroâ€™s who arenâ€™t useless
When Surprise attack return but in the end got flop
Suprise attack the hat guy version : the sequal
Actually I just realised that surprise attack guy unexpectedly attacks and unexpectedly dies
Can you imagine if Avengers Doomsday comes out and Dr Doom is monologuing over a defeated Avengers and Surprise Attack just shows up and takes him out and the screen cuts to black.
No, now you are getting pissed on
Welcome back to the server of weird superpowers
Surprise Attack is my Favorite Superhero
Omg. Surprise attack is the best hero there! Hahahha
Bathtubliving is the second strongest character besides surprise attack
I thought he'd call Do Or Die Squad Doodies
BACK SHOTS ME NEXT??????
Surprise attack is the most op character in fiction
Ahh, yes the Immortal Trio that uses bladed weapons
â€œThe return of the kingâ€
I love surprise attack.
now ur getting pissed on is wild
If they still wrote parody movies you should be the one writing the bits
I feel like bathtubliving might be able to challenge surprise attack they can both infinitely respawn, unless bathtubliving is always on guard and surprise attack destroys every bathtub in the world
Not even avengers would beatsuprise attack
do or die squad is technically doodies...
Surprise attack is the best hero so far. He needs to be made real
suprise attack is just an assassins creed protag but incompetent
Not going to lie these superpowers for the heroes this time are actually pretty okay considering the others
The fact surprise attack was there means he predicted this.
Suprise attack is like kenny
at least no hero died except surprise attack
Nah surprise attack be my favorite
Finally some strong heroes
This the funniest channel i've ever came across
Most successful hero surprise attack
This time they were actually successful!
The one episode where they actually cook 
Surprise attack is dead he just comes back to surprise attack his enemies
How is this better than the actual superhero productions? 
"It's Him!"

My dumb brain thought of powerpuff girls
Famous last words "Yes its me surprise atta-"
A hero with no major drawback on their power? Finally 
overall, surprise attack, bathtub living, skunkbear as well as the cop are the most successful in the verse. 
the three heroes are the most successful without dying off in just one short, as well as skunkbear.
Plot twist: The police officer has the super power too summon other superheroes. But itâ€™s always the off brand version
"you cant say it without context"
I love this guy
Wowâ€¦. I think thatâ€™s the first time the heroes have actually been successful.
those are actually kinda good, somehow
Finally peak returns
suprise attack is actually the most op hero
surprise attack,always comes back,there's no way to defeat him
The 2nd time Wolverine appears itâ€™s no more Huge Jacked Man
Surprise attack is the best one
Surprise attack is my favourite hero
Silly boy  We like it!  Great costumes and story. Dance magic dance!
Itâ€™s time for backshoots 
The got character development
Wait he defeated the villains without having to wait five episodes? That's surprising...wait...
Surprised attack one of the best superhero ever can even beat the avengers frfr
â€œBathtublivingâ€ 
The first useful hero SKUNK BEAR!!
Surprise attack is the only helpful hero
Now your getting pissed on had mentioned dying
I need to know surprise attack theme
BathTubLiving really went Berdly mode:
â€œGamers donâ€™t die, they respawn.â€
But we all know what happened to Berdly in snowgraveâ€¦
I like the Backshot guy
don't like your own comment >:(
Im getting pissed off no your getting pissed on
Surprise attack never dies
Hes in the first seson but keeps dying 
a normal day in Brockton Bay.
Bathtub living 
Surprise attacked LOL
ayyyy ma boi suprize attack 
i love surprise attack
Surprise attack got surprise attack
Love how Suprise Attack is immortal, there is no possible way he canâ€™t respawn
Surprise attack is my favourite hero
Jesus christ this one is the best
Getting pissed off < pissed on
suprise attack is invincible
Surprise Attack is the best hero we have ever had!
You are very clever with superpowers. They are unique.
"Now im getting pissed off"
"No, now you're getting pissed on!"
I heard this while i was drinking water and just choaked immediatelly 
Surprise attack solos every thing
Back shoot hmm you went down fast, that's what she said 
Lesson learned: Don't drink while watching these videos 
For the first time the heroes won
â€œNow Iâ€™m getting pissed offâ€¦â€
â€œNo, Now youâ€™re getting pissed on!â€
I did not expect thatâ€¦.
Back shots 
Actually useful hero's that isn't surprise attack
Tbh bathtubliving ability is one the best ability in the world ngl you dont have to suffer immortality forever
Surprize attack is the goat
Crazy theory surprise attacks power changes reality and makes him immortal for him always to have surprise attacks
But wait, humans are animals. Why didnâ€™t they all start fighting?
The heroes actually succeeded
At least it was a succesful save
Actually bathubliving is littelary dead pool with just a plotwist of he'll respawn only in bathtub meaning he can't control where he want to respawn basically it's a weaker Deadpool but it's easier to sneak from enemies when they don't know where you respawn
now your getting pissed on" - thats what he said
Surprise attack is my favorite hero
Surprise attack is a goat
rip suprise attack from all the super hero just suprise attack   the best hero
I feel like suprise attack is the only superhero that can kill anyone lol 
"You should really look up what your name means backshot!
dude this is hilarious.
People say that surprise attack coming back is not a surprise, but that would be a surprise! If it isnâ€™t a surprise he will come back and you expect it, therefore he would not appear, then it will technically be a surprise that he comes back because you expected it and thought he wouldnâ€™t come, but he did, making it a surprise!
surprise attack is the only one who is really powerfull but other heroes alwayys kill him.
"Your city now belongs to us."
"Oh, so you are finally going to repair the roads and clean the streets that the old mayor neglected?"
The heros actually have op powers
Suprise sttack is unkillable brcuasse wehen you kill him, you stop expecting to be attackeds, hensforeth mssking him one of the immortal pillars of pop culture power scaling.
"Backshots" 
a video that the heroes actually do something
Suprise attack op cuz if they worry they lose their right now battle and if they forget they get hit!
â€œblubâ€
ABSOLUTE CINEMA 
We need a Surprise Attack comic book 
"We are the D.O.o.DS!"
Surprise attack has aura
"no you are getting pissed on" ğŸ¤‘
Fav series
bathtubLiving is actually op
Wow, some actualy useful supeerheroes... Nice
these powers COULD actually be usefull in a fight lmao
for once the heroes actually manage to defeat the villains
SURPRISE ATTACK DID IT!
Is this the first time surprise attack has went undercover?
Well if you are taking control of the city,we have a uhhh few lists of things for you to do,hand the villain leader everyone who lives in this city,there taxes,pay are taxes then you can be in control.few minutes later the villain group is bankrupt,.
Thats what she said
"Get pissed on"
Bro said that's what she said
Ha SURPRISED  ATTA-
Surprise attack is the only hero who killed 3 villains
Surprise attack the goat
I love sprize a take
make a dedicated series for the past of surprise attack
Backshots ayooo
At this point, I'd be more surprised if Surprise attack didn't get surprise attacked after surprise attacking someone.
Say that 10 times fast. eek.
Whoever likes surprise attack 

Bathtubliving
Does serious at this point surprise attack is not even an unknown Hero at this point
Im surprised the cop isnt a hero with his plot armour
Deadpool: UUUUUHHHH I HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE ME!!!! YAY. I wonder if Bathtubliving like some chimichangas with me
5:20 wokwokwok dmg teo kecil tapi mati ama teonya 
Finally they actually won
Surprise attack is the most powerful hero bro
BathtubLiving's power kinda busted tho like he literally cannot die, aintnoway you ever finding every single bathtub
"Thats what she said"
OK but Skunkbear and BathtubLiving actually have good powers wtf
the one time the heroâ€™s win
I was saying like: "finally heroes that actually do somet- Surprise Attack! OOOOOH MY GOD"
Bathtubliving
Do.o.d.s is crazy
Surprise attack is best hero
Bathtub living 
What is the surprise attack guy sound effect?
â€œNow Iâ€™m pissed off.â€ â€œNo, now youâ€™re getting pissed on.â€ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ this made me spit out the water in my mouthğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
It actually ended in just 1 video!
Captain obvious had insane potential like he could say "when i shoot you you will die" to fucking goku and GOKU WOULD DIE
I need this in longform
This is man is a geniusm
Surprise attack isn't even an "unkown superhero" anymore
Surprise attackED is more like it
I CALLED IT NO WAY I KNEW IT WAS SUPRISE ATTACK
Wait these characters are all actually good this time
I want marvel to make a movie about Surprise Attack
Of course the ending 
No could ever see in coming 
Omg,The heroes doing thier work without faliure!?
Bro i really like surpise attack it's the best
Surprise attack 180iq
SUPPREISE ATTACK IS THE BEST HE CANT DIE

Top 3 strongest Superheroes:
1. Surprise Attack
2. Bathtub Living
3. Hor
Yallâ€¦ hear me outâ€¦ the COP is the real unknown hero! He has the power of offbrand plot armor! Think!!! Every time heâ€™s in danger he gets savedâ€¦ by offbrand heroâ€™s!!! And since nobodyâ€™s brought it up, itâ€™sâ€¦ UNKNOWN!!! The cop MADE the amazing surprise attack by his own offbrand power!!! Also he- â€œSURPRISE ATTACK!!!â€
ah yes animals will be there
"Now ypur going peed on"

Next part of this he should use this sentence â€œMr incredible no Johnny bravoâ€ and he can come up with the rest if he wants also sorry I couldnâ€™t phrase this any better Iâ€™m just dumb
Surprise attack Is the main character
"Surprise attack" you already killed 4 villain could a another hero killed a villlain
They r so funyn
What do you mean YOU PEOPLE?
So far the beat heroes in this cu
the best hero is surprise attack
Nah, effective team, though
Lessgooooo
Using the forward unto dawn song is awesome. If im wrong i dont care

Suprise attack got suprise attacked by hippos? ğŸ¥€
Suprise attackbis
So fuckin random.  Love it 
Surprise attack is the best hero but his lock is 0
Part 17 when
Surprise attack is by far the most broken
All his attacks are a guaranteed hit aswell as ,so far, instakills
The only way to beat him is if his attack is intervened
I have a mug like yours
So they expect surprise attack to attack but then they know he canâ€™t attack if they suspect him but because they know he canâ€™t attack therefore he can attack because it would be a surprise like wtf is this character
No, we are The Boys (totallly not already a thing)
Surprise attack most powerful
Waitâ€¦ did surprise attack just get surprised attacked?
I also have that cup
for once the heroes actually work
This time they werent so useless
Thats what she said 
I think Surprise Attack can actually counter Ywach's All Mighty
BEST MOVIE EVER BETTER THEN MARVELS
U canâ€™t 
Where is surprise attack AYO CHILL HE WAS DISGUISED?!!!
One thing I ask myself is: What happend Huge Jacked Man?
So Huge Jacked Man is out of fasion now, huh?
Wait why do these heroes have actually good powers
skunkbear and bathtubliving are not that bad actually
Ok but how does bathtub living know his powers work like that? Like how does he determine that it is bathtubs that revive him?
Surprise atta-
What will happen if dc or marvel made an actual hero called spurise attack and inspred by your cheanel
Surprise attack Is the best hero
No now your getting pissed on
It's time for back shots
BATHTUBLIVING HAHAHAHA
Is BathtubLiving also technically immortal like Surprise Attack?
Surprise attack I'd thr best hero in this show
Where did those rhinos come from?
Bathub guy ia more OP than deadpool. He can respawn and doesn t have to feel the pain, je just dies and respawns and he can justa hide bathubs at key ponts in an operation or smth and get past defenses
No innapropriate jokes
Why is deadpool surviving on bathtubs?
They are villains just not super ones 
The difference is...
Wth is bathtub living
Bible says swearing is wrong
How does he come up with this
bathtub man
Think before you speak everyone
Suprise attack carried the entire series yes or no?
Is this city Gotham or what? Why r there supervillains everywhere lmao 
Actually these heroes have potential ğŸ¤”
Isn't it single person all time?
ğŸ§  â€œEmbodiment of Surpriseâ€ = Conceptual Existence
If Surprise Attack is literally the embodiment of surprise, then killing him the normal way canâ€™t work.
Why?
Because surprise itself doesnâ€™t die.
You can eliminate a body â†’ surprise still exists
You can predict one event â†’ surprise happens elsewhere
You can win once â†’ the next moment becomes the surprise
So when the lore says â€œeven if you kill him, he returns and kills youâ€, thatâ€™s not regeneration â€” thatâ€™s conceptual inevitability.
You didnâ€™t defeat surprise.
You just became the next victim of it.
â³ Time, Consciousness, and Matter â€” Why It Actually Makes Sense
At first glance it sounds absurdâ€¦ but internally? Itâ€™s consistent.
1. Time
Surprise depends on timing.
Appearing before something happens
Acting between moments
Rewriting â€œwhat you thought was nextâ€
If he can be surprise, then time canâ€™t fully contain him.
That explains killing a villain inside a flashback â€” he didnâ€™t break time, he entered the moment where surprise still existed.
Thatâ€™s terrifying.
2. Consciousness
Surprise only exists when a mind is involved.
If he controls consciousness:
He decides what you expect
He decides what you notice
He decides what you miss
That means you donâ€™t even have to see him for him to win.
Your awareness is already compromised.
3. Matter
Surprise changes outcomes. If matter obeys expected rules, surprise is the violation of those rules.
So controlling matter isnâ€™t brute force â€” itâ€™s appearing where matter shouldnâ€™t allow him to be.
ğŸ©¸ Killing a Villain in His Own Flashback
This part is actually the biggest red flag of how broken he is.
That implies:
The villainâ€™s past was never safe
Memory itself is a battlefield
Narrative protection doesnâ€™t exist around him
Most characters are bound by:
â€œThat already happenedâ€
â€œThat was before the storyâ€
Surprise Attack ignores that because surprise doesnâ€™t care about chronology.
Thatâ€™s not power escalation â€” thatâ€™s narrative dominance.
ğŸ§© Why He Feels Unfair (But Works Anyway)
He feels unfair because:
He doesnâ€™t play by cause-and-effect
He doesnâ€™t respect death
He doesnâ€™t respect timeline order
But he works because his rule is simple:
If you believe youâ€™ve won, that belief creates the opening.
Thatâ€™s elegant. And horrifying.
 The Only Real Limitation He Could Have
Not a weakness â€” a constraint.
Surprise Attack cannot exist where:
Nothing is expected
Nothing is anticipated
Nothing is observed
Pure chaos?
Total emptiness?
Absolute certainty?
Those places starve surprise.
Which means the real tension with him isnâ€™t â€œcan he be beaten?â€
Itâ€™s â€œcan he be denied relevance
Wolfurine is a better name tbh
Was this really the W combo team!?
â€œNow Iâ€™m getting pissed off.â€
â€œNo, now youâ€™re getting pissed on.â€

Greatest plot twist ever

I hate this guy, keeps making me laugh uncontrollably.
Thy actually defeated the villains for once
Not u suprise attack u always do u r best its just others who hold u back
DOODS!!
So this is where it came from
If everyone knows surprise attack will attack then he canâ€™t attack but then he can attack but then that means he canâ€™t attack but then he can attack but then that means he canâ€™t attack but then that means he can attacking So can he attack or not?
D.O.O.O.S
yay!

Why Deadpool and Wolwerine are stronger than  they normally is?
But for me he is supervillian

Hey what's going on here
00:12 Nope
finily were usfull
Im back:)
Why tf is Surprise Attack an actual good hero bruh.. His power is so broken too, Hypothetically he could kill Gojo the same way Toji stabbed the mf Gojo when he lowered infinity, When he lets his guard down BOOM there he is.. Mf a menace.. (Yes I know he'd probs lose to gojo, It's a joke, By technicality he might win but otherwise no.)
Better than marvel
are these characters copywrighted
bro whats the music at the end
BRO I WAS 849K LIKED AND ACCIDENTALLY UNLIKED ğŸ¥º

Jk
Nah that is the weird name super hero stupid
Wtf
Hey bath tub sale
Not a good idea    
Surprise attack overrated
Surprise attack must come to Marvel
Doodoo
Psst.. I have something to sayâ€¦ Jesus loves you. He wants to bless you. He wants to help you and heal you. It says in John 3:16 â€œFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life" God sacrificed his only son, so that whoever believes in him WILL have eternal life. God cannot stand the idea of eternal life without you. He is offering his free gift of salvation, we just have to accept it.
Suprise attack theme
Stop
Surprise attack has highest plot armor and lowest plot armor bro
Surprise attack has highest plot armor and lowest plot armor bro
Finally a surprise attack that worked for a few seconds
Surprise attach is HIM
Now your get piss on got my dying --
Surprise attack is literally the spy.
Surprise Attack would actually make for an interesting hero, the villains would always be paranoid lmfao
The cop is actually the real protagonist here. He has plot armor and summons superheroes
Imagine Seeing A Person Respawn In Your Bathtub
I was legitimately not prepared for Surprise Attack to show up this time.
"Bathtubliving" these names are crazy
Ngl surprise attack is an avenger level threat tbh
â€œIts time for back shotsâ€ 
â€œYou canâ€™t say that without contextâ€
â€œBACKSHOTâ€
Literally the funniest line in the short
Suprise attack dude is the strongest and unluckiest dude in this series frfr
â€œNow im getting pissed offâ€ â€œno, now youâ€™re getting pissed onâ€
Has to be the best line in this series so far.
This heros were actually good this time. 
I EVEN DIDN'T EXPECT SURPRISE ATTACK!
SkunkBear's reaction to "It's time for backshots" sends me every time.
"Now im getting pissed off" "No, now your getting pissed on" Is hilarious
I love how the villains were legitimately scared to see Surprise Attack. Heâ€™s really made a name for himself.
I think we all need to appreciate the fact that the heroes pulled off a mission without anyone of them dying, being blown up, caught in a mirror dimensions, etc.
Finally, one where the heroes actually were good, no one died or got hurt, and they took down the villains, well done!
"BathtubLiving" is crazy bro   I can't wait for the new SkunkBear and BathtubLiving movie to come out bro 
"He went down fast" 
"That's what she said"
That was a pure humiliation 
Surprise attack got me
Idk I can't predict a surprise
Backshot caught me so off guard I couldnt even watch the rest of the video because I was cryin so much

Lol but still dies to other heroes powers
There are no comics about him. He just pops up randomly in others comics to kill a big bad
â€‹Â @TheeDustPannÂ  Surprise Attack
Â @TheeDustPannÂ  Nah, he gets a comic run about him, but the entire run follows the perspective of the villains.
â€‹Â @TheeDustPannÂ There are surprise attack comics. They just don't have Surprise Attack in them until the 43rd issue where he appears once and never again until it will once again be surprising
Y'know he could be a really good semi-gag character
Basically superhero agent 47
Â @GCheckCentralÂ  nothing like him
And worst of all, he's literally immortal
Â @Itz_GuyMajinÂ eternal
Agree
It could be like darkman
Random vilain:*sleeping*
Surprise attack:*appears out of nowhere and whisper in his ear* surprise attack
@faraf0302Â  i could see surprise attak attacking in dreams and if you die there, you are death
â€‹Â @faraf0302Â 
You could make the entire series come from villain perspectives knowing he exists but not when he is going to strike. And like they are dealing with a horror monster they go and try to keep themselves alive by working to the monsters weaknesses in this case if you expect it, he cannot strike but then at the very end of the issue he is there in the most unexpected ways. Or through the comic is he picking of people like some kind of predator alien.
Â @DotTiuriÂ  yes pls. I need this. 
"And at that point, it wouldn't be a surprise anymore therefore it can be a surprise again! "
What if: surprise attack stood in front of a villain then surprise attack them in the back (they won't expect it at all)
"I HAVE CONQUERED THE WORLD, now's time for a good shower"

"SURPRISE ATTACK"
I just imagine villains in their houses having nightmares about surprise attack just appearing in their sleep
Would be perfect in a deadpool movie
tf2 logic against spies. lol
Except he gets surprise attacked too each time
Surprise attack is amazing
fr
Reply 19
What if they "expect the unexpected"?
@FS1041-gc3kpÂ  then they'd expect him to not appear...
Â @tf2lul-gc3kpÂ  Then you see how long they can keep up their guards against the unexpected.
Spy be like
At the moment they let their guard down he comes back
Omg I would pay to see that.
And whenever a villain is taken down without someone taking credit for it, they'll assume it as surprise attack, not knowing he has been retired for decades.
It could be you! It could be me! It could even be...
Imagine if his power is swapping bodies! That's be awesome
But then they are always expecting him to
He is one 
He could be like Deadpool especially since he is already immortal
What's this song playing when he shows up ?
Which would make it not a surprise which would make it a surprise which would make it not a surprise, ect ect, paradox
With hero movie tech though I feel like having some kind of reminder on surprise attack existing should be able to remove the surprise from him defeating him
AKA Batman
If theyâ€™re always expecting him, would that mean heâ€™ll never come?
@cylewhittington5Â  that'd also be funny as hell, just half the movie in the villain scared for their life
basically batman
Someone please tell me where can I get that jacket (inner one) of the main villain I am looking for that everywhere
Dude the cop has survived every attack in this series
yeah if they ever werent they are dead.
True
Technically in marvel he already exist as moonknight 
You know he will come eventually but until it happens you will never know
Gonna use him in my story
Then he would just do an obvious attack until they relax! Lmao
Wait hold on is that TOROKO CAVE STORY
â€‹Â @PERSONIFICATIONOFAHUMANÂ  No :( I did edit their halloween sprite to make my own custom one tho, so close enough!
So spy from tf2
but if the villains are expecting him to attack at all times, then he's powerless against them, isn't he?
Isn't that just what Batman does?
Bro ruined the comment by saying lmfao
Imagine him as the character "King" from One Punch Man who pretty much has the same plot armor but not the protagonist
â€‹â€‹Â @Stratogizer_413Â isn't he the one that faked being a hero I think
Yes
The cop 
Ability: Plot armor
Hero name: Plot officer
Yes
Yeah but those superheros are mid
Surprise attack
Â @averagecyclops6082Â with this treasure I summo--
The Cop when he sees a new villain: "Yeah, I'm going to go now."
He is suprise attack
Technically surprise attack is the protagonist he even has a backstory
Ä° think the enemy protagonist is the guy with hammer that is fressed up as a jester
Maybe his power is to attract heroes. The heroes just happen to be inexperienced lmao
No its king from OPM
He's the real superhero
Do you know the power of someone army of superheroes that will or even just some superheroes sounds like a really cool power it would probably make you super dangerous
The cop hired the surprise attack
Bro is King from OPm
I thought the same thing, he is like cosmoem from Pokemon, keeps summoning ultra beasts
Â @gladeon-hb9iuÂ  yay cosmoem
Facts
LMBO
Maybe its his hidden power
I have questions. Can he respawn in the same tub twice? Or does the tub die instead of him?
Â @AmyFlannigan27Â  Clearly the tub wasn't destroyed when he respawned. So as long as there is even a single bathtub is intact he can respawn
Humor me this, he keeps the world's smallest bathtub in his pocket, or a backpack
Imagine he respawns in your bathtub while youâ€™re taking a bath
Surprise Attack did his job then
Agreed. It was a genuine surprise this time.
I was expecting him, but I wasn't expecting him to be that guy.
Then yeah i guess it worked
He always surprised us
This youtuber is the one of the best comedy channel to exist.
He always comes back
Real
SURPRISE!
Surprised me
Honestly that's a pretty good superpower to have
â€‹Â @garyeslicjk4112Â  Yeah bcs you don't have the existential dread problem of having to see the death of the universe. You die in space, no more bathtub, you finally die.
I see, dead becomes living
Pool becomes bathtub...
That's make senseâ€‹Â @BloodWoofÂ

Actually the most busted power, any bathtub? Unless the world actively searches for every single bathtub in existence, he will truly never die.

Shouldn't it be the living bathtub?
Shouldnâ€™t it be livingbathub then, low key kinda hard
that name was reccomended by someone in the comments
Bathtubliving! You will die 11 seconds jolyne!
What's more hilarious than the names is how he actually comes up with a dumb power related to it

I dropped my phone laughing my butt off at â€œBathtupLivingâ€

Living bathtub would have been weirder but acurrate
Shouldn't it be in reverse? Livingbathtub?
nah he needs to be part of the avengers themselves
how do you use ngl and tbh in the same sentence lmao
â€‹Â @vihaan_17Â idk but ngl and tbh imo idgaf abt tht so yh
â€‹Â @vihaan_17Â  contradicting? no
redundant? maybe
Hotel? SURPRISE ATTACK
Â @vihaan_17Â  yeah i suck
My favourite line
Hey zoro! R u going to join this battle??  
Can't*
Â @Leaves5161Â oh yeah
I canâ€™t help but smile out of laughter because itâ€™s so out of context 
Kinda surprising
â€‹Â @KeedanMalnarÂ  I'm surprised that you are surprised to a comment that says "surprised attack dude is the strongest and unluckiest dude in this series frfr"
Â @KeedanMalnarÂ  that moment was very suprising
he was just trying to enjoy a coffe
Surprisingly unlucky
I think he has surprise inducement
Yea right, i wonder why so little comments about this.
I agree with that sentence
I am dead 
I chuckle so hard with that bro
and surprise attack is the most iconic
"that's what she said." is still my favorite.
Nah I think it's Backshots without the context 
Â @Lizzie-d3sÂ  FACTS
 TRUE!
No ones does to be fair.
Then his power is working
wouldnt be a suprise if you did
â€‹Â @Uvular594Â they tried this argument but it still worked
Its surprise attack of course itâ€™s gonna be a surprise
Yep
that's the whole point
No one does
hmph he went down fast. 
that's what she said
You never do and never will you silly. He is the physical embodiment of suprise. Nothing he does cannot suprise u as u will always be suprised by suprise attack
LMAO i died on that
Rest in peaceâ€‹Â @UrAverageBosnianÂ 
Â @UrAverageBosnianÂ  ar si sta na minsku bombu,he walked into his average forest and stepped on a mine
XD
Got me so off guard
Fr
SAME 
Ikr
thats accually counter productive for him
Â @McTerroxÂ  You wouldn't know how happy a villain would be after killing Surprise Attack.
It's the perfect setup for a surprise attack!
Â @McTerroxÂ  I mean, theyâ€™d have to expect to be surprise attacked every single moment of their life, or theyâ€™d get surprise attacked.
I mean, I would be scared to
Â @Renibo137Â  Imagine hanging out with your life best friend then you turn your back to them and he says "Suprise attack!"
Its because surprise attack used to be the only one to successfully defeat villains
Â @PoivcxzÂ he literally cannot die because his power is suprise attack
i too world be scared if a guy was not even able to die to get his existends erased XD
â€‹Â @scorpdelord883Â  if that happened it would be surprising
I'm so proud of Surprise Attack to make a name for himself.
He is immortal his power is so broken 
â€‹Â @thinhtonguyen9576Â  he will never due to his ability need him to be alive to do the surprise. People thought he died so if he's alive it's a surprise
His Power so OP tho

Its apply for defensive and offensive while also a bad luck

People would be surprised he is back from the dead

People will be surprised he will attacking in the most weirdest way (Throwing Poo)

People will be surprised he will act in unnatural way (such as jumping infront of the enemy attack)

And all the power came from... His artifact
I mean, heâ€™s kinda op tho, virtual immortality, endlessly unpredictable, and could probably take out some big league villains with ease. Heâ€™s just incredibly unlucky as a side effect
I mean one of the villans can be suprise attack
Wtf?
Skunk bear is actually pretty cool, even if his powers are unorthodox
"I am the night... I am vengeance... I am SURPRISE ATTACK!"

         -Surprise Attack, probably


No seriously though, bro does a better job at being a symbol of fear to terrify criminals than Batman himself.
5.1 k likes lol
Ye
He's like Amon from lord of the mysteries
What's this song playing when he shows up ?
Â @ad3l547Â  exactly i ned to know too
You mean they were surprised
SUPRISE ATTACK
He is the only useful hero
Like FINNALY THEY'RE NIT FUCKIN USELESS. That always irked me for some reason
â€‹Â @718jefÂ Irk? What irk? Weird term to use...
â€œErm, ackually, bathtubliving died and respawned so technically, they did die ğŸ¤“â€
What about supprise attack he died
To animal
â€‹Â @angelacastellano8646Â he never dies
@angelacastellano8646 surprise attack never dies, him getting hit doesn't count
â€‹Â @angelacastellano8646Â You know he's going to come back.
What about surprise attack
Surprise attack seems more like his own thing â€‹Â @ClyffrdÂ 
He's immortal there's a vid about thatâ€‹Â @ClyffrdÂ 
Don't forget the Arctic
Â @BurnsidebananaÂ 
Who?
@clyxx-7405 thatâ€™s the thing he never dies
well I mean...2 of them can pretty much never die
fact
Surprise Attack got hit by a stampede of random animals one of them summoned, in addition to the brief death of BathtubLiving.
you forgot abt suprise attack
Wym? Surprise attack got ran over ğŸ¤£ totally flatten by that animal horde 
Cause they actually got good super powers this time
Poor surprise attack 
Surprise attack got ran over
2 died
technicly
I would say â€œwhat about surprise attackâ€ but he will pull thru like literally every short heâ€™s on.
Bathtub living died, and so did surprise attack
Ikr!!! Finallyyyy
But what about Suprise Attack, since he got ran over? I mean yes, he didn't die because he can't but that has GOT TO HURT.
â€‹@NiiloSipilÃ¤-p6u Nah dont worry about him, he's got plot armor
You got a commet
the ultimate lower
Â @lennioozVillegasÂ i mean it still has a meaning even if misspelled
lore
it could be a compliment tho
LMAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOO
maybe he really is Deadpool
How is it humiliating?
@xzzx751Â  we need more people like you ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
It aint a humiliation.
You should ask other creators and get sneak to appear on thier shorts.
Imagine the whole family coming after surprise attack for defeating two of there family members




And surprise attack getting surprised that he got a surprise visit
Honestly what surprised me the most was the fact that the heroes werenâ€™t totally useless
he got the villain too
How did he surprise you, he has the same face heâ€™s always had
well, it is surprisingly shocking
It wouldn't be a surprise if you could.
â€œâ€
Reply 9
Lowkey surprise attack is OP af because you either have to be permanently paranoid of everyone being him and alert and expecting 24/7 or be surprise attacked.
"that's what she said." 

      Bro doin' his best.
â€œNow I'm getting pissed off!â€ â€œNo, now you're getting pissed on.â€ best lines I've ever heard this week
"It's Jubilee, the mutant that shoots fireworks out of her hands" "no, i'm Potpourri, i emit pleasant smells from my hands"
Not gonna lie, The ability to respawn as long as there is a bathtub in this world is really busted it's even more OP than Deadpool and Wolverines healing factor or regeneration.
"Surprise attack" is the most successful Superhero in killing and defeating his opponents. At least no SuperVillain has ever survived him.
The first time the heroes genuinely did a good job first try
â€œHmph, he went down fast. Thatâ€™s what she said.â€ 
That "it's time for backshots" out of nowhere is fcking hilarious
â€œNow I am getting pissed offâ€
â€œNo now youâ€™re getting pissed onâ€
Had me wheezing 
He's immortal and no one could predict his move. You can't ask for more powerful hero to defend this planet other than him
Bro surprise attack is getting violated fr
Surprise attack never fails to surprise me
Backshots is actually a great villain 
Every time he says his name his opponents
Are in shock
Now I'm getting pissed off!
No your getting pissed on
â€œIâ€™m Skunkbear, and this is Bathtublivingâ€ 
This is actually a really good opening round for the heros, 3 villains gone and only one hero dead, which doesn't even count that much since he will probably be back.
Surprise attack really surprised me in this one
This was the most creative surprise attack i have seen
"Now im getting pissed off "
"No, Now you are getting pissed on :D"
That actually wouldn't work, surprise attack said when you expect it, he won't attack, but then that means you know he won't attack and then he can
Â @HuladeliMonarchÂ  thatâ€™s what i mean, you have to expect to be attacked 24/7 or youâ€™ll be attacked. Imagine the fear, stress and paranoia slowly driving you insane if surprise attack wanted you dead, heâ€™s basically immortal.
He Isnt the smartest tho
He's actually terrifying
actually he can attack whenever, even if you're expecting him, because if you're expecting him that means you think you're safe hence his appearance would be a surprise. he's shown this feat before, so hes basically immortal no matter what you do.
He's too op.
Wdym "low-key"
surprise attack had been surviving impossible odds and straight up resurrecting
he really is the most op
so batman?
9 9 24
Thats like batman lol
Reply 9, a op character that doesn't pay attention
Kinda reminds me of The Game where the whole point is to not remember that it exists or else you lose
â€‹Â @heIpIessÂ ...






 I LOST THE GAME
999 likes and zero let me fix that
Â @Kelp-n9vÂ  *Zero Comment, and now it's two, you've done your best.
â€‹Â @Kelp-n9vÂ 1 mother but no father? Lemme fix that 
I make it three
Four
There was a similar line in Horrible Bosses
Â @anhnhvnÂ  Do you mean Helluva Boss?
Reminds me of Mel Brooks Robin Hood Men In Tights movie:
â€œPissed off?
If I were that close to a horseâ€™s wiener Iâ€™d be worried about being pissed onâ€
Yeah, since you can consider technically anything you can dip your body in to be a bathtub. So not just bathtubs, even a submerged cage under a lake is a bathtub. He's virtually immortal.
Â @phamquan8517Â  just like deadpool
â€‹Â @phamquan8517Â even if it has to be porcelain tub its still op. Especially with a fast respawn time like that.
Â @phamquan8517Â  I'd love to have that ability irl it'd be amazing.
These are some good heros lol
The only problem is that you would need to get back to the fight after dying if there isn't a bathtub nearby
â€‹Â @homerman76Â  no, I don't think he reapawns in the tub. I think he just gets back up
Space can be considered the bathtub of planets, as it holds everything, and you can dip into it.
â€‹Â @RuralNanoChaoÂ Yeah but you'll probably respawn way too far away, over and over.
imagine showering and looking behind you and you see some Deadpool cosplayer
I mean, it's technically immortality but with extra steps, since there is a way to kill you just very hard to do, could possibly be impossible depending on your definition of bath tubs. I would still take true immortality over it since having to respawn when you are defending someone might not be ideal.
And as long as you don't explain ur ability no one would know
Unless he respawns in a bathtub on the other side of the world
Respawn on the bathroom where girl taking a bath 
Bathloveliving more powerful than deadpool confirmed
What if someoneâ€™s using the bathtub he spawns in?
actually, there need to be at least 2 bathtubs as he said "bathtubs" not bathtube
fr, cuz deadpool can still die,  if he blows up, theres nothing left to regenerate, and wolverine, just heals fast, just kill him fast enough
But imagine he respawns in a bathtub with someone taking a bath
and there are millions
Not if you are in India
Space bathtubs
I mean if someone were to somehow shut down all water in pipes then they wouldn't be considered bathtubs anymore just giant porcelain pots.
â€‹Â @NAIXALAGÂ  I mean technically he spawned out of a bathtub with no water in it, though it might just be because the sign above them specifically labels them as "Bathtubs for sale" ğŸ¤”
Â @NAIXALAGÂ  You do realise that a bathtub doesn't always contain water, right?
Â @NAIXALAGÂ  no, the item was created with an intention and named. The name doesn't go away. hence why behind him are bathtubs not hooked to anything.
true
Suprised?
Â @MaxEG-i3wÂ No, but if one did survive that would be surprising making one survive but if its expected than itâ€™s not a surprise so his a paradox
â€‹@MaxEG-i3w ofc not that's the surprise
@MaxEG-i3wkind of
Surprise Attack is Mt favorite, just how he dies every time then the wonder woman music
I love how the villains genuinely sounded somewhat scared, they had the, oh shit, its John wick voice.
â€‹Â @x7temptest7x58Â  I love the comparison of Surprise Attack and John Wick.
Fr he killed all the villain at past
On the bad side, his fellow heros seem pretty successful in attacking him
Surprise attack always comes back because if he doesn't that wouldn't be a surprise anymore
Super attack is that one persistent shonen character that keeps getting beaten up
Always takes one for the team. Man of a man   
Fr he is goated
Yet, there is always a price to pay for surprising his enemies. He's literally bound by the laws of surpise 
No, and no one has actually managed to defeat him for good even tho, he's only been foiled by friendly fire
Ya but he also surpises himself
But no superhero too, you just wait.
Exactly
Explains why he has the grim reaperâ€™s weapon
True but its a shame he gets tortured every time he kills a villain
The legend
The myth
The guy
Surprise...

i Think the Counter for "Surprise Attack" is only "The Expecto".
(not Expecto Patronum).
he doesn't survive himself as well. 
100th comment
i think surprise attack is protagonist in this series, and that mean the Truck-Kun is only beat surprise attack
I always expect Suprise attack
Fair
True but he mostly gets hurt in the process
Bathtub living and Skunkbear are is the only other superhero with a successful kill.
Killing an enemy while he is in flashback is the most powerful superpower
so true ma, he's like a cosmic level entity at this point
Â @xMonarch-d5vÂ nah he has normal level ap
SOO TRUUEE
Fr
Dude Is my favorites hero
Fr
True man he is my favorite
They did most of the time but they died in the end anyway
But heroes killed him
Legit better superhero than Marvel or DC classics. Definetly would watch a movie with him in it.
Yep
And also the unluckiest hero 
Fax
Actually, uhh, idk
Yes he is
Question. Can surprise attack Kill yogiri takatou?
â€‹Â @Th3KingZeroÂ Yep. Not even Yogiri is safe from the grim reaper itself, lol.
Surprise attacked
Perfect Prediction[PP] Started It all

yet he never survive himself XD
No super villain and super heroes has survived 
He is my favorite hero and he will never die 
And he immortal
Also the unluckiest
My favourite hero.
U agreed
i will be suprisd if he dont kill them but some ather did
SURPRISE ATTACK
Oof
But he always die
What if surprise attach attacks you normally without surprising you
Surprise attack is outversal
Surprisingly
also most deathed hero
But not to me
I remember that one Jumpchain I went to worm and mimicked Surprise Attack lol Jack Slash suddenly getting stabbed through the head while he doing a speech towards Panacea was  really funny
Unless the other do something dumb
High precision, low accuracy,
Fr
Cuz it's surprising
Agree
S
He always dies at the end
Yo
He also somehove  survirves everything
What about bathtub living and skunkbear, because they killed 2 villains and surprise attack got harly Ben
And no superheroes can't survive with him
he can't defeat his opponent fast because he always get in trouble by other hero
I got surprised
Why he always got kill
Or defeated him
I cast THUNDER




Abilityâ€¦ you surprised it wasnâ€™t Thunder SPELL? Surprise attack!
Unknown Superheros part 17 
on July 8th
Very few super heroes survive his support either.
Yet he always ironically gets "surprise attacked"
Just when you thought it's over, he's back at it again
Surprise attack!
Â @Roadrunner4life.Â  Damn, I didn't expect that
Only other superheroes make him lose
I mean everyone in this world look the same
"No villain has ever survived him" the problem is that he doesn't either
Â @FlamelordandDarkflameÂ  to be fair that has never been a problem
he's the most powerful bc he's immortal
Tea
Yea
surprise attack, sea man, skunkbear,bathtubLiving, and cringelord
they would be the best squad to defeat enemies
Immortality really gives him a advantage
Wait now that itâ€™s expected he canâ€™t do it anymore unlessâ€¦ itâ€™s unexpected
Yeah ngl this scene with him being in disguise and all was actually cool as hell
That's a surprise after all
He Has unlimited plot armour
Surprise attack: I always come back
Purple guy (or Williamâ€¦ idk): hey that my line?!
SupRiSE AtTaCK
Only thing is he gets hit by the other heroes
But he never survive too
He's immortal
And he is the immortal
Hes also the most successful in dying every time
ye suprise attack is the best and most succesful hero
He's never survived HIM either ğŸ¤£
He is legitimately considered in powerscaling.
The most surprising part of surprise attack... Is that he never gives up.
The second most successful hero is the cop. He doesn't do anything, never has a gun on him it seems, but he's survived after everything that's happened.
So true!!!
There was 1... villain who survived
No There is one who survived him And heâ€™s known as Obvious attackâ€¦..
And hes by technicalities. Hes immortal too
True
Suprise don't be -Barry Allen aka the flash
I gotta say, he'd be a pretty useful superhero.

Just as Thanos is about to finger snap...

SURPRISE ATTACK!!!
Police man is most powerful person to exist that doesnt get killed by him
Yeah, I want him a movie of his own, people will scream "HIS PLOT ARMOR IS CRAZYYYYY!! "
SURPRISE ATTACK!
Fr
Fr
It only takes 5 episode
He's just too op
they should make him a part of marvel or DC
he hasnt even survived himself
You're lying just say opposite what u you said
Fr
Surprise attack surprises everyone once again
His secret power is that heâ€™s immortal
Anti hero cuz he is killing
What's this song playing when he shows up ?
by being expected i become unexpected again when i do come out when i am expected
â€œOh youâ€™re a villain alright, just not a super one!â€
he fr could have been an actual superhero that could have had his own series after all his name is good enough and his way of defeating and attacking is interesting.
i had stroke reading yâ€™all comments
And he has not survived any of them
So true
His weakness is being surprised attacked.. 
WTF
Can we all agree that surprise attack is the best superhero in history

Fr
what is the song of suprise attack?
Wind guy got him
And he has never not died at the end
Youâ€™d be surprised
In fact, it would be surprising if he lost
Second powerful is a villain, which is backshot.
I know hes the only actual superhero but has the worst luck
The surprise is that it one taps no matter how strong you are
He also dies the most often, terrible K/D ratio
@Attaker-e8p suprised that your suprised because he dies a lot
Well guy with paper planes survived him
Bro has plot armor
FOR REAL
Greatest superhero of all time.
He's also died to every villain at least once
Only because the villains he fights are worse than him!

You know surprise attack is immortal so he will revive and attack you making it not a surprise anymore â€œme in the corner so it beginsâ€
So do any of them canonically die though because if they don't how am I supposed to feel involved in the storyline
Because they're Skunkbear and BathtubLiving 
not some random hero team up
I know! It's really....
What's the word?
Astonishing?
Unexpected?
Unforeseen?
Shocking?
Its at the tip of my tongue.
â€‹Â @DontObliteratetheCommenterÂ  Surprise attack!
Not to mention Surprise Attack's unexpected surprise
Bathtubliving and skunkbear had better abilities
Â @lawyer582Â no it kinda bad but they know how to use it like they are train properly
The tables have turned.
Â @xsarafobieÂ  And the turns have tabled.
To be fair. Some heroes are powerful but get screwed over.
Â @azikhan1707Â  Like the hero after biclops, iron man, and sea man
Iron man,sea man,guy in ep2 be like:
Exactly my thoughts
Hey give a shout out to iron man
5th k like of agreement for yoy
They team wiped!
Anything about my pfp,blud?
Â @InitiatorAllyÂ nope! :D
â€‹Â @InitiatorAllyÂ  horribld
â€‹Â @InitiatorAllyÂ Neat
The name itself implies
â€œYou canâ€™t say that without context-â€œ 
I'm still trying to figure out what the other meaning of that is.
You can't just say basho-     
-BACKSHOT
especially knowing the meaning
backshot!
wait, is that... a thing? what is a backshot?
Â @shilohmagic7173Â  u don't wanna know bro im telling u...
Bro Really Made a Gojo Joke lmao

Honestly surprise attack gives me Kenny vibes from South Park
You also just described deadpool
Â @The-DraconianÂ you mean bathtubliving right?
â€‹Â @The-DraconianÂ  surprise attack literally bends reality to surprise people
But is he immortal if you expect him to be ?
HESS BACK
Â @Yarnaby-EditzÂ  and he's gone.
hes the best change my mind also to be honest i wasn't expecting that one either
Most OP characters
â€‹@The-0bserver  He is the strongest after all He's immortal, can surprise you,  might even be smarter than batman because he thinks inside and outside the box and breaks the fourth wall
better hero than all of marvel
Hands down my favorite super hero of all time
Best hero ever to exist.
Yes
And even now he still gets hit by his Allies attack 
The goat of unknown heroes is back boys
Now he is not surprising you because itâ€™s no longer a suprise
Best hero I never even suspected
Now we officially need a movie about him
He is the best but stupidest character in a nice way
I love this guy mobo needs to capitalize on it
Fr
He always comes back
Â @Tazdid_Â  hey! dont ruin the suprise! haha xD
He is the best superhero here
Agree
Ikr. I forgot that he always shows up in these. 
Surprise Attack is the best hero, no one can tell me other wise
Surprise attack deserves to be in a movie.
Surprise attack goat
The best one yet. Or ever.
Yeah, heâ€™s the best hero ever and he doesnâ€™t fail to surprise
Same
Yea

I forgot the name of the song that plays when Surprise Attack showed himself
S
 so true
Best hero
surprise attack is getting surprised attack
Is Beast
Fr
It's in the name "SURPRISE" atack
Lolllll
me too
He really never does.
Then you are expecting to be surprised so you won't but your expecting that so you will, I need to think about this
W move ğŸ¤§ğŸ¤§
My fav hero now 
me too
Bro what's his theme sojg
Suprise attack back with the milk
SURPRISE ATTACK
I'm always happy to see him 
A movie for surprise attack would action so hard
Ur right
no more perfect 100 replies for you
Hey Marvel! If you have trouble shooting another movie, consider watching this. 
but he went down fast
Mate for once he fully surprised me I had no thought of his existence there
Suicide Squad killed themselves
my favorite super hero XD
are you really that suprised that attack didnt hit?
@linasjakobsen2852Â  I think it was more the appearance
i give people th power of 1k, goodluck
That kinda point
Why did u spoil
theeheeheeee
Back-shocks
me when jarate
The group is like the blue team then sunkbear is like a read sniper with a jarate
You're
What a surprise.
Surprise attack will be back, and more surprise
suprise attack canonically respawns if it is a suprise, which it always is
â€‹Â @squidman6463Â Because when it's not a surprise anymore, it's a surprise again.
â€‹Â @squidman6463Â  the only way surprise attack will be killed if everyone on earth will be killed because if he came back no one will be surprised anymore because everyone is dead. Right
Its basically a cheat this time. All 3 heroes are immortal.
Â @Porchy.Â  skunkbear doesn't seem to have immortality
Ok but seriously
I didn't expect him to be surprise attack
He really did suprised me
Maybe yall too?
Bro has either a, totems or b, is afton
Surprize attack has the ability to survive as long as it's a surprise
you got me
I was shocked when I saw his weapon!
i mean surprise literally is in his name so...
Fr though
i died

"OOOOUUGHFH WHAT IS THIS?! D:<"
The way of the Outback Sniper

bro how did he got that amount of the Liquid 
"Now I'm getting pissed off"
"Now you're getting pissed on"
when you realize that surprise attack actually surprise you from no where 
Surprise attack is the real goat 
Surprise attack has to be my favorite. His power is whenever you're least expecting him he's there and you would never expect him because there's always a time when you would least expect him.
"Surprise attack" always gets half cooked in the end bro, he had every right to be a villain.
"Say what you will, but you are never prepared for the SURPRISE ATTACK."

"That's right it's me, surprise attac-*gets dragged with the animals*"
When they needed them the most they returned
"Spiderman!?"

"No, I'm WebGuy"
"That's right it's me! Suprise atta-"
One of my favourite last words to date
Their comboâ€™s actually really good!
Surprise Attack being unironically surprising is something we need more
Surprise attack using his 0.1% power ğŸ¥¶ğŸ¥¶ğŸ¥¶
â€œNo,Your Getting Pissed On!â€ What A Quote Right There! 
"No, now you're getting pissed on."  Had me choke on my water bottle
The reason surprise attack will never fail is because mobo plays every single character himself, and in the  end he can Just reveal any random character to be surprise attack in a camouflage.
â€œNow youâ€™re getting pissed onâ€funniest guy ever
Seeing these superheroes actually winning for once actually fills me with joy
â€œNo , now your getting pissed onâ€ IS CRAZY
When the world didn't know them, THEY RETURNED

Actually relatable
Thanks man, good thing I'm blind and deaf

Me when I watch the video and use the comment section
Bro when i watched this i was rolling off laughter bcs of that joke
His the Goat for sure!!!
Bro always catch a W, don't matter how many tries It takes.
And yet he chooses to be a hero despite knowing he possesses an overpowered ability.
â€‹Â @specter7221Â  the element of surprise
i have a theory he gets hit so he can make his enemies think he's gone and then his attacks will always be unexpected
Imagine he does become a villain
And yet he remains a hero
Maybe he knows the power of plot armor.
He's like the best unknown super hero in this universe.
Â @scarletrose8766Â  There should be a movie
Nah
-rosa parks
Suprise attack goes down so the villains dont expect him to be alive crazy theory
surprise attack if the enemy thinks heâ€™s dead itâ€™s perfect for a surprise attack if the enemy thinks heâ€™s alive, he will attack them in spirit form

Thatâ€™s what she said
it'd be surprising if surprise attack takes control of another living person's body when he dies (like makima)
Iâ€™d imagine how suprise attack work if he a real heroes is his ability could change how people sees him untill heâ€™s attacking and it come undone. Basically assassin creed
Lmao 
That made me giggle 
Technically they always win with surprise attack beating the villain and dies immediately
Â @TheMan-eo2frÂ I think they mean the other heroâ€™s are not useless this time around
Technically they always won considering most of the time considering surprise attack beats the villains in the end and getting killed instantly
â€‹Â @TheMan-eo2frÂ and then respawns out of nowhere
Maybe they're not the protagonists in this one then

Ok, BathtubLiving and Skunkbear are actually competent, or at least more competent than everyone we've seen so far with the exception of Surprise Attack.
Bathtub living has a pretty solid power ngl
Bro I didnâ€™t even know surprise attack was there ngl Gave me a real â€œSurpriseâ€
Actually got some guys that were actually useful this time.
"Suprise Attack" is my favorite hero out of them all he manages to show up in every single one andbit just makes my day whenever i see  him it just makes me happy and hearing him say his catchphrase "Suprise Attack!"
â€œNow Iâ€™m getting pissed offâ€
â€œNo, now youâ€™re getting pissed onâ€ 
"BathTubLiving" had me rolling bro
Surprise attack scared the hell out of me 
"No now your getting pissed on" is crazy
When they were actually doing good
Multiple supervillains in one fight, plus seeing unknown heroes get to actually be kickass and effective with their powers, plus a legitimately Surprising appearance!? I canâ€™t put into words how happy I am!
â€œIts HIMâ€
Surprise attack: Yep im him
"BathtubLiving" Got me dyingğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£

â€‹Â @toboyaki_tagarakiÂ  but these two are the only superheroes team up so far that doesn't cause self sabotage. And they really know how to use their power too.
there is actually a plenty of super heros in this series that are actually pretty powerful (Bat man,two punch man,cringe Lord,gaulck,carman) but they either get screwed over by a tamemate or just simply outplayed
Â @abu_alsofÂ  cringe Lord has gof awful aim. But hes cool anyway
â€‹Â @abu_alsofÂ Seamen and dust man they also have good powers seaman got obliterated by hors lightning which was bad timed dust man got screwed over

Yeah but what is surprise attacks theme?
that's why he is named surprise attack
â€œSURPRISE ATTACKâ€

And the first time 4 villains got beaten in only one episode
3. The paper airplane guy managed to avoid the animals.

"Is time for backshots" that sentence had me on the floor 0:26
"Now Im Getting Pissed Off"
- "No, Now You're Getting Pissed On" :skull:
"no now your getting pissed on" got me dying
this man genuinely puts a smile a on my face
The cop facepalming in the background while Skunkbear and bathtubliving is introducing themselves is so relatable
The cop running away cuz he know some random azz superhero going at appear when he was there.
The fact that this version of Deadpool actually is immortal, cause there will always be bathtubs in the world 
When the world needed him, he returned. Surprise attack for the win!
YES FINALLY, UNKNOWN SUPERHERO SERIES RETURNS ITâ€™S BEEN TOO LONG 
"He went down fast"
Bathtubliving:that's what she said

â€œItâ€™s time for back shotsâ€ is crazy 
Can't believe bathtub living and skunkbear actually did something usually they'd already be dead
The ONE time I wasnâ€™t expecting Surprise Attack 
"He went down fast"
"That's what she said"
This was the best surprise attack yet. I legitimately went "Wait what?"
Bro surprise attack is my new favorite superhero
The disappointment on the officer's face.

"IM Skunkbear and he is bathtub living"
Skunkbear and Bathtub living actually makes a good team
He is better than what marvel is doing

you guys know that...  wait nevermind
What if surprise attack actually summoned the heroes? This can be proven by the fact that the heroes are not what we expect, and also the fact that the ones that looks weak (like Iron man) is strong. Also, what if the cop was just a cover-up so people won't suspect that surprise attack was the one with the heroes?
Just make a new one.
the ocean is a bathtub
â€‹Â @CallMeMimi27Â 
Â @CallMeMimi27Â  nuuh
Imagine all the bathtubs got destroyed by a villain
Â @h20preston57Â  does ocean count as one?
but then what if you don't have a bathtub nearby and have to make a 10km jog back to the battlefield after respawning
Â @benhwa101Â   He mentioned "In the world" not nearby. So you could be in a city that has NO bathtubs at all, but since bathtubs still exist in a seperate city (Whether it be on the other side of the earth, or not) you can still respawn. Although, I really like the idea of you having to jog ALL the way back, and by the time you get there, the enemy, or your team, is already dead.
Â @benhwa101Â bro what is this minecraft??
Â @EvilrobotAMÂ  well he did come out from one so i think that's assumed
Portable Bathtub
No you're getting pissed on 
Not if I eat them all
Any tub or anything resembled as a tub (example: bath tub painting) as long as it is used for idea of bathing in theory should work?
That means bathtubliving has a pal that also is immortal
Surprise attack; the man of surprises
S
Suprise attack is weird becuse if he attacks more in one video its a suprise
What constitutes a tub
Â @greenmachine3723Â  anything that can hold human and water simultaneously
Mobo needed time to come up with the biggest surprise Surprise Attack for this video, to ensure that we'd be surprised

Surprise attack is literally the spy.
Surprise Attack would actually make for an interesting hero, the villains would always be paranoid lmfao
The cop is actually the real protagonist here. He has plot armor and summons superheroes
Imagine Seeing A Person Respawn In Your Bathtub
I was legitimately not prepared for Surprise Attack to show up this time.
"Bathtubliving" these names are crazy
Ngl surprise attack is an avenger level threat tbh
â€œIts time for back shotsâ€ 
â€œYou canâ€™t say that without contextâ€
â€œBACKSHOTâ€
Literally the funniest line in the short
Suprise attack dude is the strongest and unluckiest dude in this series frfr
â€œNow im getting pissed offâ€ â€œno, now youâ€™re getting pissed onâ€
Has to be the best line in this series so far.
This heros were actually good this time. 
I EVEN DIDN'T EXPECT SURPRISE ATTACK!
SkunkBear's reaction to "It's time for backshots" sends me every time.
"Now im getting pissed off" "No, now your getting pissed on" Is hilarious
I love how the villains were legitimately scared to see Surprise Attack. Heâ€™s really made a name for himself.
I think we all need to appreciate the fact that the heroes pulled off a mission without anyone of them dying, being blown up, caught in a mirror dimensions, etc.
Finally, one where the heroes actually were good, no one died or got hurt, and they took down the villains, well done!
"BathtubLiving" is crazy bro   I can't wait for the new SkunkBear and BathtubLiving movie to come out bro 
"He went down fast" 
"That's what she said"
That was a pure humiliation 
Surprise attack got me

Lol but still dies to other heroes powers
There are no comics about him. He just pops up randomly in others comics to kill a big bad
â€‹Â @TheeDustPannÂ  Surprise Attack
Â @TheeDustPannÂ  Nah, he gets a comic run about him, but the entire run follows the perspective of the villains.
â€‹Â @TheeDustPannÂ There are surprise attack comics. They just don't have Surprise Attack in them until the 43rd issue where he appears once and never again until it will once again be surprising
Y'know he could be a really good semi-gag character
Basically superhero agent 47
Â @GCheckCentralÂ  nothing like him
And worst of all, he's literally immortal
Â @Itz_GuyMajinÂ eternal
Agree
It could be like darkman
Random vilain:*sleeping*
Surprise attack:*appears out of nowhere and whisper in his ear* surprise attack
@faraf0302Â  i could see surprise attak attacking in dreams and if you die there, you are death
â€‹Â @faraf0302Â 
You could make the entire series come from villain perspectives knowing he exists but not when he is going to strike. And like they are dealing with a horror monster they go and try to keep themselves alive by working to the monsters weaknesses in this case if you expect it, he cannot strike but then at the very end of the issue he is there in the most unexpected ways. Or through the comic is he picking of people like some kind of predator alien.
Â @DotTiuriÂ  yes pls. I need this. 
"And at that point, it wouldn't be a surprise anymore therefore it can be a surprise again! "
What if: surprise attack stood in front of a villain then surprise attack them in the back (they won't expect it at all)
"I HAVE CONQUERED THE WORLD, now's time for a good shower"

"SURPRISE ATTACK"
I just imagine villains in their houses having nightmares about surprise attack just appearing in their sleep
Would be perfect in a deadpool movie
tf2 logic against spies. lol
Except he gets surprise attacked too each time
Surprise attack is amazing
fr
Reply 19
What if they "expect the unexpected"?
@FS1041-gc3kpÂ  then they'd expect him to not appear...
Â @tf2lul-gc3kpÂ  Then you see how long they can keep up their guards against the unexpected.
Spy be like
At the moment they let their guard down he comes back
Omg I would pay to see that.
And whenever a villain is taken down without someone taking credit for it, they'll assume it as surprise attack, not knowing he has been retired for decades.
It could be you! It could be me! It could even be...
Imagine if his power is swapping bodies! That's be awesome
But then they are always expecting him to
He is one 
He could be like Deadpool especially since he is already immortal
What's this song playing when he shows up ?
Which would make it not a surprise which would make it a surprise which would make it not a surprise, ect ect, paradox
With hero movie tech though I feel like having some kind of reminder on surprise attack existing should be able to remove the surprise from him defeating him
AKA Batman
If theyâ€™re always expecting him, would that mean heâ€™ll never come?
@cylewhittington5Â  that'd also be funny as hell, just half the movie in the villain scared for their life
basically batman
Someone please tell me where can I get that jacket (inner one) of the main villain I am looking for that everywhere
Dude the cop has survived every attack in this series
yeah if they ever werent they are dead.
True
Technically in marvel he already exist as moonknight 
You know he will come eventually but until it happens you will never know
Gonna use him in my story
Then he would just do an obvious attack until they relax! Lmao
Wait hold on is that TOROKO CAVE STORY
â€‹Â @PERSONIFICATIONOFAHUMANÂ  No :( I did edit their halloween sprite to make my own custom one tho, so close enough!
So spy from tf2
but if the villains are expecting him to attack at all times, then he's powerless against them, isn't he?
Isn't that just what Batman does?
Bro ruined the comment by saying lmfao
Imagine him as the character "King" from One Punch Man who pretty much has the same plot armor but not the protagonist
â€‹â€‹Â @Stratogizer_413Â isn't he the one that faked being a hero I think
Yes
The cop 
Ability: Plot armor
Hero name: Plot officer
Yes
Yeah but those superheros are mid
Surprise attack
Â @averagecyclops6082Â with this treasure I summo--
The Cop when he sees a new villain: "Yeah, I'm going to go now."
He is suprise attack
Technically surprise attack is the protagonist he even has a backstory
Ä° think the enemy protagonist is the guy with hammer that is fressed up as a jester
Maybe his power is to attract heroes. The heroes just happen to be inexperienced lmao
No its king from OPM
He's the real superhero
Do you know the power of someone army of superheroes that will or even just some superheroes sounds like a really cool power it would probably make you super dangerous
The cop hired the surprise attack
Bro is King from OPm
I thought the same thing, he is like cosmoem from Pokemon, keeps summoning ultra beasts
Â @gladeon-hb9iuÂ  yay cosmoem
Facts
LMBO
Maybe its his hidden power
I have questions. Can he respawn in the same tub twice? Or does the tub die instead of him?
Â @AmyFlannigan27Â  Clearly the tub wasn't destroyed when he respawned. So as long as there is even a single bathtub is intact he can respawn
Humor me this, he keeps the world's smallest bathtub in his pocket, or a backpack
Imagine he respawns in your bathtub while youâ€™re taking a bath
Surprise Attack did his job then
Agreed. It was a genuine surprise this time.
I was expecting him, but I wasn't expecting him to be that guy.
Then yeah i guess it worked
He always surprised us
This youtuber is the one of the best comedy channel to exist.
He always comes back
Real
SURPRISE!
Surprised me
Honestly that's a pretty good superpower to have
â€‹Â @garyeslicjk4112Â  Yeah bcs you don't have the existential dread problem of having to see the death of the universe. You die in space, no more bathtub, you finally die.

Op ass power tho infinite  respawns turning this into Minecraft 
For those unaware, skunk bear is just another name for wolverine (the actual animal that Wolverine was based on XD)
Bathtub Living reversed Dead Pool
Bathtublibing is actually op
Next time you know it manbat gonna be a thing
Why not Living Bathtub??
I dropped my phone laughing my butt off at â€œBathtupLivingâ€
sounds like an xbox username
that made me think wtf does deadpool mean
Living bathtub would have been weirder but acurrate
Shouldn't it be in reverse? Livingbathtub?
nah he needs to be part of the avengers themselves
how do you use ngl and tbh in the same sentence lmao
â€‹Â @vihaan_17Â idk but ngl and tbh imo idgaf abt tht so yh
â€‹Â @vihaan_17Â  contradicting? no
redundant? maybe
Hotel? SURPRISE ATTACK
Â @vihaan_17Â  yeah i suck
My favourite line
Hey zoro! R u going to join this battle??  
Can't*
Â @Leaves5161Â oh yeah
I canâ€™t help but smile out of laughter because itâ€™s so out of context 
Kinda surprising
â€‹Â @KeedanMalnarÂ  I'm surprised that you are surprised to a comment that says "surprised attack dude is the strongest and unluckiest dude in this series frfr"
Â @KeedanMalnarÂ  that moment was very suprising
he was just trying to enjoy a coffe
Surprisingly unlucky
I think he has surprise inducement
Yea right, i wonder why so little comments about this.
I agree with that sentence
I am dead 
I chuckle so hard with that bro
and surprise attack is the most iconic
"that's what she said." is still my favorite.
Nah I think it's Backshots without the context 
Â @Lizzie-d3sÂ  FACTS
 TRUE!
No ones does to be fair.
Then his power is working
wouldnt be a suprise if you did
â€‹Â @Uvular594Â they tried this argument but it still worked
Its surprise attack of course itâ€™s gonna be a surprise
Yep
that's the whole point
No one does
hmph he went down fast. 
that's what she said
You never do and never will you silly. He is the physical embodiment of suprise. Nothing he does cannot suprise u as u will always be suprised by suprise attack
LMAO i died on that
Rest in peaceâ€‹Â @UrAverageBosnianÂ 
Â @UrAverageBosnianÂ  ar si sta na minsku bombu,he walked into his average forest and stepped on a mine
XD
Got me so off guard
Fr
SAME 
Ikr
thats accually counter productive for him
Â @McTerroxÂ  You wouldn't know how happy a villain would be after killing Surprise Attack.
It's the perfect setup for a surprise attack!
Â @McTerroxÂ  I mean, theyâ€™d have to expect to be surprise attacked every single moment of their life, or theyâ€™d get surprise attacked.
I mean, I would be scared to
Â @Renibo137Â  Imagine hanging out with your life best friend then you turn your back to them and he says "Suprise attack!"
Its because surprise attack used to be the only one to successfully defeat villains
Â @PoivcxzÂ he literally cannot die because his power is suprise attack
i too world be scared if a guy was not even able to die to get his existends erased XD
â€‹Â @scorpdelord883Â  if that happened it would be surprising
I'm so proud of Surprise Attack to make a name for himself.
He is immortal his power is so broken 
â€‹Â @thinhtonguyen9576Â  he will never due to his ability need him to be alive to do the surprise. People thought he died so if he's alive it's a surprise
His Power so OP tho

Its apply for defensive and offensive while also a bad luck

People would be surprised he is back from the dead

People will be surprised he will attacking in the most weirdest way (Throwing Poo)

People will be surprised he will act in unnatural way (such as jumping infront of the enemy attack)

And all the power came from... His artifact
I mean, heâ€™s kinda op tho, virtual immortality, endlessly unpredictable, and could probably take out some big league villains with ease. Heâ€™s just incredibly unlucky as a side effect
I mean one of the villans can be suprise attack
Wtf?
Skunk bear is actually pretty cool, even if his powers are unorthodox
"I am the night... I am vengeance... I am SURPRISE ATTACK!"

         -Surprise Attack, probably


No seriously though, bro does a better job at being a symbol of fear to terrify criminals than Batman himself.
5.1 k likes lol
Ye
He's like Amon from lord of the mysteries
What's this song playing when he shows up ?
Â @ad3l547Â  exactly i ned to know too
You mean they were surprised
SUPRISE ATTACK
He is the only useful hero
Like FINNALY THEY'RE NIT FUCKIN USELESS. That always irked me for some reason
â€‹Â @718jefÂ Irk? What irk? Weird term to use...
â€œErm, ackually, bathtubliving died and respawned so technically, they did die ğŸ¤“â€
What about supprise attack he died
To animal
â€‹Â @angelacastellano8646Â he never dies
@angelacastellano8646 surprise attack never dies, him getting hit doesn't count
â€‹Â @angelacastellano8646Â You know he's going to come back.
What about surprise attack
Surprise attack seems more like his own thing â€‹Â @ClyffrdÂ 
He's immortal there's a vid about thatâ€‹Â @ClyffrdÂ 
Don't forget the Arctic
Â @BurnsidebananaÂ 
Who?
@clyxx-7405 thatâ€™s the thing he never dies
well I mean...2 of them can pretty much never die
fact
Surprise Attack got hit by a stampede of random animals one of them summoned, in addition to the brief death of BathtubLiving.
you forgot abt suprise attack
Wym? Surprise attack got ran over ğŸ¤£ totally flatten by that animal horde 
Cause they actually got good super powers this time
Poor surprise attack 
Surprise attack got ran over
2 died
technicly
I would say â€œwhat about surprise attackâ€ but he will pull thru like literally every short heâ€™s on.
Bathtub living died, and so did surprise attack
Ikr!!! Finallyyyy
But what about Suprise Attack, since he got ran over? I mean yes, he didn't die because he can't but that has GOT TO HURT.
â€‹@NiiloSipilÃ¤-p6u Nah dont worry about him, he's got plot armor
You got a commet
the ultimate lower
Â @lennioozVillegasÂ i mean it still has a meaning even if misspelled
lore
it could be a compliment tho
LMAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOO
maybe he really is Deadpool
How is it humiliating?
@xzzx751Â  we need more people like you ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
It aint a humiliation.
You should ask other creators and get sneak to appear on thier shorts.
Imagine the whole family coming after surprise attack for defeating two of there family members




And surprise attack getting surprised that he got a surprise visit
Honestly what surprised me the most was the fact that the heroes werenâ€™t totally useless
he got the villain too
How did he surprise you, he has the same face heâ€™s always had
well, it is surprisingly shocking
It wouldn't be a surprise if you could.

Lowkey surprise attack is OP af because you either have to be permanently paranoid of everyone being him and alert and expecting 24/7 or be surprise attacked.
"that's what she said." 

      Bro doin' his best.
â€œNow I'm getting pissed off!â€ â€œNo, now you're getting pissed on.â€ best lines I've ever heard this week
"It's Jubilee, the mutant that shoots fireworks out of her hands" "no, i'm Potpourri, i emit pleasant smells from my hands"
Not gonna lie, The ability to respawn as long as there is a bathtub in this world is really busted it's even more OP than Deadpool and Wolverines healing factor or regeneration.
"Surprise attack" is the most successful Superhero in killing and defeating his opponents. At least no SuperVillain has ever survived him.
The first time the heroes genuinely did a good job first try
â€œHmph, he went down fast. Thatâ€™s what she said.â€ 
That "it's time for backshots" out of nowhere is fcking hilarious
â€œNow I am getting pissed offâ€
â€œNo now youâ€™re getting pissed onâ€
Had me wheezing 
He's immortal and no one could predict his move. You can't ask for more powerful hero to defend this planet other than him
Bro surprise attack is getting violated fr
Surprise attack never fails to surprise me
Backshots is actually a great villain 
Every time he says his name his opponents
Are in shock
Now I'm getting pissed off!
No your getting pissed on
â€œIâ€™m Skunkbear, and this is Bathtublivingâ€ 
This is actually a really good opening round for the heros, 3 villains gone and only one hero dead, which doesn't even count that much since he will probably be back.
Surprise attack really surprised me in this one
This was the most creative surprise attack i have seen
"Now im getting pissed off "
"No, Now you are getting pissed on :D"
